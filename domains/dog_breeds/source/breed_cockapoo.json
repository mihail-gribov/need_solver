  "name": "Cockapoo",
  "full_description": "<p>The Cockapoo is a hybrid breed resulting from the cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle, primarily the Miniature Poodle. This intentional crossbreeding began in the United States during the 1960s, aiming to combine the desirable traits of both parent breeds into a single companion dog. The objective was to create a dog with the Poodle's hypoallergenic coat and the Cocker Spaniel's friendly disposition. Over the decades, the Cockapoo has gained popularity worldwide, especially in countries like the United Kingdom and Australia, where they are also known as 'Spoodles'.</p>\n<p>Physically, Cockapoos exhibit a wide range of appearances due to the variability inherent in crossbreeding. They typically weigh between 12 to 25 pounds and stand about 10 to 18 inches tall at the shoulder. Their coats can vary from straight to wavy or curly, reflecting the genetic influence of their Poodle ancestry. Common coat colors include black, white, buff, cream, apricot, red, chocolate, and various combinations thereof. Their eyes are round and expressive, often dark brown or hazel, and they possess long, floppy ears covered in soft, feathered fur.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Cockapoos are known for their affectionate and friendly nature. They inherit intelligence from both parent breeds, making them quick learners and generally easy to train. Their sociable disposition means they thrive on human interaction and often form strong bonds with their families. However, this attachment can lead to separation anxiety if they are left alone for extended periods. They are energetic and require regular physical and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and potential behavioral issues.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as companion animals, Cockapoos have no specific working roles. Their primary purpose has always been to serve as loving and loyal family pets. In modern times, their popularity has surged, particularly among families and individuals seeking a friendly, intelligent, and relatively low-shedding dog. Their adaptable nature makes them suitable for various living environments, from apartments to houses with yards.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Cockapoo include their hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally, making them a preferred choice for allergy sufferers. Their size and energy levels make them versatile companions, suitable for both active individuals and those seeking a more relaxed pet. Additionally, their friendly demeanor often makes them excellent therapy dogs, providing comfort and companionship to those in need.</p>",
