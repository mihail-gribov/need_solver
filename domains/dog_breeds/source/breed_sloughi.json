  "full_description": "<p>The Sloughi, also known as the Arabian Greyhound, is an ancient sighthound breed originating from North Africa, particularly Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Esteemed for its hunting prowess, the Sloughi was traditionally used to pursue game such as gazelles, hares, foxes, jackals, and wild boars across diverse terrains, including deserts, mountains, and brushlands. Historical evidence, such as Neolithic rock paintings and Egyptian tomb art, suggests the breed's existence dates back thousands of years. The Sloughi's introduction to Europe occurred in the late 19th century, with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) officially recognizing the breed in 1934. The American Kennel Club (AKC) granted full recognition to the Sloughi in 2016, classifying it within the Hound Group. Physically, the Sloughi is a medium to large-sized dog characterized by a lean, athletic build. Males typically stand between 26 to 29 inches (66-72 cm) at the shoulder, while females range from 24 to 27 inches (61-68 cm). Their weight varies from 40 to 62 pounds (18-28 kg). The breed's coat is short, smooth, and fine, with colors spanning from light sand to mahogany red-fawn, often accompanied by brindling or black markings. Notably, the Sloughi's head is long and wedge-shaped, featuring large, dark, oval to almond-shaped eyes that convey a gentle, somewhat melancholic expression. Temperamentally, Sloughis are known for their noble and somewhat aloof demeanor. They exhibit strong loyalty and affection towards their families but can be reserved around strangers. Their independent nature, coupled with a keen prey drive, necessitates early socialization and consistent training. Historically bred for hunting, Sloughis possess remarkable speed, agility, and endurance, making them adept at coursing game over long distances. In contemporary settings, while they are primarily cherished as companions, they excel in activities like lure coursing, which align with their innate hunting instincts. Despite their ancient lineage, Sloughis remain relatively rare outside their native regions. Their unique combination of elegance, athleticism, and loyalty continues to captivate enthusiasts worldwide.</p>",
