  "full_description": "<p>The English Springer Spaniel is a versatile and energetic breed, renowned for its hunting prowess and affectionate nature. Originating in England, these dogs were developed to flush and retrieve game, earning their name from their ability to 'spring' game from dense brush. Historically, they share a close lineage with the English Cocker Spaniel; both breeds were once born in the same litters, with size determining their classification. The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed in 1902, followed by the American Kennel Club in 1910. Physically, English Springer Spaniels are medium-sized dogs with a compact, athletic build. Males typically stand about 20 inches tall and weigh between 40 to 53 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. They possess a medium-length, weather-resistant coat that can be flat or wavy, commonly found in liver and white or black and white colorations. Feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and belly adds to their distinctive appearance. Their expressive eyes and long, pendulous ears contribute to their alert and friendly expression. Temperamentally, these spaniels are known for their friendly, eager-to-please demeanor. They are intelligent and highly trainable, making them excellent companions for active families. Their sociable nature means they thrive on human interaction and can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for extended periods. Originally bred as gundogs, English Springer Spaniels excel in flushing and retrieving game. Their keen sense of smell and boundless energy make them adept at various canine sports and activities. In modern times, they have found roles beyond hunting, serving as search and rescue dogs, detection dogs for law enforcement, and beloved family pets. Their versatility and affectionate nature have contributed to their enduring popularity. Notable characteristics of the breed include their boundless energy, intelligence, and adaptability. They require regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. Their affectionate nature makes them excellent companions, but potential owners should be prepared for their high exercise needs and grooming requirements.</p>",
