  "full_description": "<p>The Beagle is a small to medium-sized hound breed renowned for its keen sense of smell and tracking abilities. Originating in England during the 16th century, Beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, a practice known as beagling. Their lineage traces back to ancient hounds used by the Romans and later refined in Britain to create a breed adept at scent tracking. Physically, Beagles possess a sturdy, compact build with a slightly domed skull and a straight, square-cut muzzle. Their expressive, large brown or hazel eyes convey a gentle and pleading expression. The ears are long, set low, and hang close to the cheeks, enhancing their acute sense of hearing. They have a short, dense, and weatherproof coat that comes in various colors, including tricolor (black, tan, and white), lemon and white, and red and white. The tail is moderately long, set high, and carried gaily, often with a white tip. Beagles are known for their amiable and alert temperament. They are friendly, curious, and merry, making them excellent companions for families and individuals alike. Their even disposition and lack of aggression or timidity contribute to their popularity as household pets. Originally bred for hunting, Beagles possess remarkable stamina and determination. Their primary function was to hunt hare by following a scent, utilizing their exceptional olfactory senses. This background contributes to their strong instinct to follow scents, which can sometimes lead them to wander if not properly supervised. In modern times, Beagles have transitioned from hunting companions to beloved family pets. Their manageable size, friendly nature, and adaptability make them suitable for various living environments, including apartments and houses with yards. They are also employed in roles that utilize their scent detection abilities, such as in customs and border protection services for detecting contraband. Notable characteristics of the Beagle include their distinctive baying howl, which they use during hunts and when they catch an interesting scent. They are also known for their food motivation, which can be advantageous during training but requires careful management to prevent obesity. Their sociable nature means they thrive on companionship and can experience separation anxiety if left alone for extended periods.</p>",
