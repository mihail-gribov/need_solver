  "name": "Gordon Setter",
  "full_description": "<p>The Gordon Setter, originating from Scotland in the early 17th century, was developed primarily for hunting game birds such as partridge, grouse, pheasant, and quail. The breed was named after the 4th Duke of Gordon, who played a significant role in refining and promoting these dogs. Initially known as the black-and-tan setter, the breed was officially recognized as the Gordon Setter in 1924 by Britain's Kennel Club. Physically, the Gordon Setter is the largest of the setter breeds, with males standing between 24 to 27 inches tall and weighing 55 to 80 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. They possess a sturdy, well-muscled build, a deep chest, and a level topline. Their coat is medium-length, straight or slightly wavy, predominantly black with rich chestnut or mahogany markings. The feathering on their ears, chest, belly, and tail adds to their elegant appearance. Temperamentally, Gordon Setters are intelligent, bold, and outgoing. They are known for their loyalty and affectionate nature towards their families. While they can be reserved with strangers, they are not aggressive. Their strong hunting instincts make them alert and responsive. Originally bred as bird dogs, Gordon Setters excelled in locating and retrieving game. Their stamina and keen sense of smell made them invaluable to hunters. In modern times, while they still participate in hunting and field trials, they have also become cherished family companions and perform well in various dog sports, including obedience and agility. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive black-and-tan coloration, exceptional memory, and a youthful spirit that often lasts well into their senior years.</p>",
