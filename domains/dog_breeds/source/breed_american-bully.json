  "full_description": "<p>The American Bully is a modern companion dog breed that originated in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. Developed by crossbreeding the American Pit Bull Terrier with various bulldog-type breeds, the goal was to create a dog with a muscular build and a gentle, family-friendly temperament. The breed was first recognized by the American Bully Kennel Club (ABKC) in 2004 and by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 2013. Physically, the American Bully is a robust and heavily muscled dog with a broad chest, short back, and pronounced bone structure. Its head is large and square-shaped, featuring a well-defined jawline. The breed's short, smooth, and glossy coat comes in a variety of colors, including black, brown, gray, red, white, and tricolor. The American Bully is divided into four size categories: Pocket (under 17 inches at the shoulder), Standard (17 to 20 inches), Classic (same height as Standard but lighter), and XL (20 to 22 inches). Despite its formidable appearance, the American Bully is known for its friendly, affectionate, and loyal nature. It is highly people-oriented and thrives on human interaction, making it an excellent family companion. The breed is intelligent and eager to please, which facilitates training. However, early socialization and consistent training are essential to ensure well-rounded behavior. Originally bred as a companion dog, the American Bully does not have a history of working roles. Its primary purpose has always been to serve as a loyal and loving family pet. In modern times, the breed has gained popularity worldwide, appreciated for its unique combination of strength and gentleness. Notable characteristics of the American Bully include its muscular physique, friendly demeanor, and adaptability to various living environments. The breed's versatility and affectionate nature make it suitable for families, singles, and seniors alike.</p>",
