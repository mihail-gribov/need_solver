  "full_description": "<p>The Bluetick Coonhound is a breed with a rich heritage, tracing its origins to the United States. Developed primarily in Louisiana, this breed emerged from a blend of English Foxhounds and various French hounds, notably the Grand Bleu de Gascogne. These French hounds were renowned for their cold noses, enabling them to track old or faint scents, a trait highly valued in hunting. The Bluetick Coonhound was officially recognized as a distinct breed by the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1946, separating it from the English Coonhound category. Physically, the Bluetick Coonhound presents a muscular and athletic build, designed for endurance and agility. Males typically stand between 22 to 27 inches at the shoulder, weighing 55 to 80 pounds, while females range from 21 to 25 inches in height and weigh between 45 to 65 pounds. Their coat is short, dense, and glossy, predominantly dark blue with a thickly mottled pattern, interspersed with black spots on the back, ears, and sides. Tan markings may appear over the eyes, on the cheeks, chest, and below the tail. The head and ears are predominantly black, contributing to their distinctive appearance. Temperamentally, Bluetick Coonhounds are intelligent, friendly, and energetic. They possess a strong prey drive, making them excellent hunters, yet they are also known for their loyalty and affectionate nature towards their families. Their keen sense of smell and determination make them adept at tracking and treeing game, particularly raccoons. In modern times, while they continue to excel in hunting roles, Bluetick Coonhounds have also become cherished companions in active households. Their unique coat pattern, combined with their expressive eyes and characteristic 'bawl' or 'bugle' voice, adds to their appeal. Notably, their ability to stay on intricate tracks and their endurance in the field set them apart as exceptional working dogs.</p>",
