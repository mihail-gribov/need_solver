  "name": "Saint Bernard",
  "full_description": "<p>The Saint Bernard is a giant working dog breed originating from the Western Alps of Switzerland and Italy. Developed in the 17th century by monks at the Great St. Bernard Hospice, these dogs were initially bred for rescue operations in the treacherous mountain pass. Their keen sense of direction and ability to navigate deep snow made them invaluable in locating and saving lost travelers. Physically, Saint Bernards are massive and muscular, with males standing between 28 to 30 inches (71 to 76 cm) tall and weighing 140 to 180 pounds (63.5 to 81.5 kg), while females are slightly smaller at 26 to 28 inches (66 to 71 cm) tall and weighing 120 to 140 pounds (54.5 to 63.5 kg). They possess a broad head, deep chest, and a powerful build. Their coat can be either short-haired (smooth) or long-haired (rough), both featuring a dense double layer that is water-resistant. Common coat colors include white with red, red and brindle, or white with black markings. Temperamentally, Saint Bernards are known as gentle giants. They are calm, patient, and affectionate, making them excellent companions, especially for families with children. Their protective nature is evident, yet they are not aggressive, displaying a friendly demeanor towards strangers. Historically, their primary role was mountain rescue, utilizing their strength and endurance to traverse snowy terrains and locate stranded individuals. Today, while they are primarily cherished as family pets and show dogs, their legacy as rescue dogs remains a significant part of their identity. Notable characteristics of the breed include their impressive size, gentle temperament, and historical significance in alpine rescue missions.</p>",
