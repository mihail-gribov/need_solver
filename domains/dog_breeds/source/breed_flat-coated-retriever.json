  "full_description": "<p>The Flat-Coated Retriever, originating in mid-19th century England, was developed as a versatile hunting companion adept at retrieving game both on land and in water. Its ancestry likely includes the Newfoundland, various spaniel-type water dogs, setters, and sheepdogs, contributing to its exceptional retrieving abilities. Initially known as the \"Wavy-Coated Retriever,\" the breed gained popularity among gamekeepers for its proficiency in retrieving shot game. However, its prominence declined in the early 20th century, overshadowed by the rise of the Labrador and Golden Retrievers. Post-World War II, dedicated breeding efforts revitalized the Flat-Coated Retriever, restoring its status as a cherished companion and working dog. Physically, the Flat-Coated Retriever is a medium to large-sized dog, with males standing between 23 to 24.5 inches tall and females slightly shorter at 22 to 23.5 inches. Their weight ranges from 60 to 80 pounds, with females typically on the lighter end. The breed's most distinctive feature is its glossy, flat-lying coat, which can be solid black or liver in color. This medium-length coat is straight or slightly wavy, providing protection against various weather conditions. Feathering is present on the ears, chest, legs, and tail, adding to the breed's elegant appearance. The head is long and \"of one piece,\" with a minimal stop and a backskull approximately equal in length to the muzzle. Dark brown, almond-shaped eyes convey an intelligent and friendly expression, while small, pendant ears lie close to the head. The Flat-Coated Retriever is renowned for its cheerful and outgoing personality. Often described as the \"Peter Pan\" of retrievers due to their prolonged youthful exuberance, they are affectionate, friendly, and eager to please. This breed thrives on human companionship and is known for its playful nature, often retaining a puppy-like demeanor well into adulthood. Their intelligence and adaptability make them excellent family pets, though their high energy levels require regular mental and physical stimulation. Originally bred for retrieving game, the Flat-Coated Retriever excels in both land and water retrieval tasks. Their keen sense of smell, combined with boundless energy and a strong desire to please, makes them proficient in hunting scenarios. In modern times, while they continue to participate in hunting and field trials, they have also found roles in search and rescue operations, therapy work, and as loyal family companions. Despite their many virtues, Flat-Coated Retrievers are less common than some other retriever breeds, contributing to their unique appeal among enthusiasts. Notable characteristics of the breed include their ever-wagging tail, indicative of their happy disposition, and their versatility in various canine sports and activities. Their combination of elegance, intelligence, and affability makes them a cherished breed among those who appreciate an active and engaging canine companion.</p>",
