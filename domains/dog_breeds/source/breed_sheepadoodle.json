  "full_description": "<p>The Sheepadoodle is a designer dog breed resulting from the cross between an Old English Sheepdog and a Poodle, typically a Standard Poodle. This hybrid was initially developed in the 1960s by the U.S. Army for military purposes, aiming to combine the intelligence and hypoallergenic coat of the Poodle with the strength and loyalty of the Old English Sheepdog. However, their playful and gentle nature made them more suitable as family companions than military working dogs. The breed gained popularity in the late 20th century, especially in North America and Europe, as a loving and intelligent family pet. Physically, Sheepadoodles are medium to large-sized dogs, with males generally standing between 20 to 25.5 inches at the shoulder and weighing 60 to 88 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, standing 19 to 24.5 inches and weighing 55 to 84 pounds. Their coats are typically soft and wavy to curly, often resembling the Poodle's hypoallergenic fleece. Common coat colors include black and white, gray, cream, and occasionally merle or tri-color blends. Their expressive dark eyes and floppy ears contribute to their endearing appearance. Temperamentally, Sheepadoodles are known for their affectionate, intelligent, and playful nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are generally good with children and other pets. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, excelling in obedience and agility activities. Originally bred for herding and retrieving, Sheepadoodles possess a strong work ethic and enjoy having tasks to perform. In modern times, they are primarily cherished as family companions and therapy dogs, valued for their friendly disposition and adaptability. Notable characteristics of the Sheepadoodle include their hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally, making them suitable for individuals with allergies. Their combination of intelligence, loyalty, and playfulness makes them well-suited for active families seeking an engaging and loving pet.</p>",
