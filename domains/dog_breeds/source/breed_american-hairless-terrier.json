  "full_description": "<p>The American Hairless Terrier (AHT) is a distinctive breed that originated in the United States in the early 1970s. This breed emerged when a hairless puppy named Josephine was born in a litter of Rat Terriers in Louisiana. Recognizing the uniqueness of this hairless trait, breeders Edwin and Willie Scott selectively bred Josephine, leading to the establishment of the American Hairless Terrier as a separate breed. The United Kennel Club recognized the AHT in 2004, and the American Kennel Club followed in 2016. Physically, the AHT is a small to medium-sized dog, typically standing between 12 to 16 inches tall and weighing between 12 to 18 pounds. The breed is characterized by its hairless skin, which can display a variety of colors and patterns, often with freckles that may darken with age. Some AHTs are born with a short, dense coat, but the hairless variety is more common. Their ears are V-shaped and can be erect, tipped, or buttoned, and they possess a muscular, compact body with a slightly longer length than height. Temperamentally, American Hairless Terriers are known for their energetic, alert, and intelligent nature. They are curious and playful, making them excellent companions for active individuals or families. Their friendly disposition allows them to get along well with children and other pets when properly socialized. Originally bred from Rat Terriers, which were used for hunting vermin, the AHT retains a strong prey drive. However, due to their lack of a protective coat, they are not suited for traditional hunting roles. Instead, they excel in various dog sports such as agility and obedience, showcasing their trainability and enthusiasm. In modern times, the American Hairless Terrier has gained popularity as a companion dog, especially among individuals with allergies, as they are known to cause fewer allergic reactions compared to other breeds. Their unique appearance and lively personality have endeared them to many, making them a cherished member of the terrier group. Notable characteristics of the AHT include their hairless skin, which requires special care to protect against sunburn and cold temperatures. They are also known for their strong prey drive, intelligence, and affectionate nature, making them both a unique and loving companion.</p>",
