  "full_description": "<p>The Yorkshire Terrier, affectionately known as the Yorkie, is a small yet spirited breed that originated in the mid-19th century in the English county of Yorkshire. Developed by workers in cotton and woolen mills, the breed was created by crossing various terriers, including the Black-and-Tan Terrier, Paisley Terrier, and Clydesdale Terrier, with the primary goal of producing an adept ratter to control rodent populations in textile mills.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Yorkshire Terrier is diminutive, typically weighing no more than 3.2 kg (7 pounds). They possess a fine, straight, and silky coat that is traditionally grown long and parted down the middle of the back. The coat color is a distinctive combination of dark steel-blue on the body and rich tan on the head, chest, and legs. Their small, V-shaped ears stand erect, and they have a compact, well-proportioned body.</p>\n<p>Yorkies are known for their bold and confident temperament. Despite their small size, they exhibit the tenacity and courage typical of terriers. They are affectionate with their families, often forming strong bonds with their owners. Their energetic and playful nature makes them lively companions. However, they can be wary of strangers and may exhibit a protective demeanor.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for their working abilities in rat control, Yorkshire Terriers have transitioned into beloved companion animals. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them relatively easy to train, though they can exhibit a stubborn streak. They excel in various canine sports and activities, including agility and obedience competitions.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Yorkshire Terrier has become one of the most popular toy breeds worldwide. Their small size makes them well-suited for urban living, and their hypoallergenic coat appeals to individuals with allergies. They are often seen accompanying their owners in various settings, from city apartments to suburban homes.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their long, flowing coat, which requires regular grooming to maintain its appearance and health. Their alert and inquisitive nature makes them excellent watchdogs, as they are quick to sound the alarm when they sense something amiss. Despite their delicate appearance, they are hardy and adaptable, embodying a blend of elegance and tenacity that endears them to dog enthusiasts around the globe.</p>",
