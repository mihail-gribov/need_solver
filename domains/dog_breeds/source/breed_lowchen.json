  "name": "Löwchen",
  "full_description": "<p>The Löwchen, meaning 'little lion' in German, is a small, lively companion breed with a rich history dating back over 400 years. Originating in pre-Renaissance Europe, particularly in regions like Germany, Belgium, and France, the Löwchen was cherished by the aristocracy as a companion and foot warmer. Depictions of these dogs appear in art from the 15th century, highlighting their longstanding presence. By the 20th century, the breed faced near extinction, with only about 40 individuals remaining in the 1960s. Dedicated breeders, notably Belgian Madame Bennert, spearheaded efforts to revive the Löwchen, leading to its recognition by the American Kennel Club in 1996. Physically, the Löwchen is a compact, well-proportioned dog standing between 10 to 14 inches tall and weighing 9 to 20 pounds. Its long, wavy, and silky coat comes in various colors and is traditionally groomed in a 'lion cut,' where the hindquarters are clipped short while the front remains full, accentuating its lion-like appearance. The breed's expressive, round eyes and high-set tail carried over the back add to its distinctive look. Temperamentally, the Löwchen is affectionate, intelligent, and playful. It thrives on human companionship, displaying a cheerful disposition and eagerness to please. These traits make it an excellent family pet, adaptable to various living situations. Historically bred solely for companionship, the Löwchen has no working dog lineage but has proven versatile in modern canine sports such as obedience and agility. Today, while still considered rare, the Löwchen enjoys a stable presence among dog enthusiasts worldwide, valued for its unique appearance and endearing personality.</p>",
