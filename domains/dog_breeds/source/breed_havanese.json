  "full_description": "<p>The Havanese, a member of the Bichon family, is the national dog of Cuba. Originating from the now-extinct Blanquito de la Habana, which descended from the Bichón Tenerife, the breed was developed in Cuba as a companion for the island's aristocracy. Following the Cuban Revolution, the breed faced near extinction but was revitalized in the United States during the 1970s, leading to its recognition by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1996. Today, the Havanese is celebrated for its affectionate nature and distinctive appearance.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Havanese is a small, sturdy dog, standing between 9 to 11 inches at the withers and weighing approximately 7 to 13 pounds. Its body is slightly longer than its height, giving it a rectangular profile. The breed's most notable feature is its long, silky, and wavy double coat, which comes in a variety of colors and patterns. The coat is lightweight and soft, often described as \"cool to the touch.\" The Havanese's expressive eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown, except in chocolate-colored dogs, which may have lighter eyes. Its ears are set high, folding down close to the cheeks, and its tail is plumed, carried over the back in a gentle arc.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, the Havanese is known for its friendly and outgoing personality. These dogs are highly social, thriving on human companionship and forming strong bonds with their families. They are intelligent and eager to please, making them highly trainable. Their playful and sometimes clownish behavior endears them to both adults and children. While they are alert and can serve as good watchdogs, they are generally not aggressive and tend to be welcoming to strangers.</p>\n<p>Historically, the Havanese was bred primarily as a companion dog for the Cuban elite, serving as a lapdog and family pet. Unlike some other breeds, it was not developed for specific working roles such as herding or hunting. In modern times, the Havanese has gained popularity worldwide as a beloved companion animal. Its adaptability makes it suitable for various living environments, from apartments to larger homes. The breed's hypoallergenic coat and minimal shedding also contribute to its appeal among dog enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Havanese include its unique gait, often described as springy or lively, reflecting its cheerful disposition. The breed's coat, while beautiful, requires regular grooming to prevent matting and tangling. Additionally, the Havanese's strong desire for human interaction means it does not do well when left alone for extended periods, as it can develop separation anxiety. Overall, the Havanese is a charming and affectionate breed, well-suited to families and individuals seeking a devoted and playful companion.</p>",
