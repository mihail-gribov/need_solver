  "full_description": "<p>The Borzoi, also known as the Russian Wolfhound, is a breed of sighthound that originated in Russia during the 13th century. Developed by the Russian aristocracy, these dogs were bred for hunting wolves and other game across vast open terrains, relying on their keen eyesight and remarkable speed. The breed's name, 'Borzoi,' is derived from the Russian word 'borzáya,' meaning 'fast.'</p>\n<p>Physically, Borzois are large, elegant dogs characterized by their long, narrow heads and slightly domed skulls. Males typically stand at least 28 inches tall at the withers, while females are at least 26 inches. Their weight ranges from 75 to 105 pounds for males, with females being 15 to 20 pounds lighter. The breed's coat is long, silky, and can be flat, wavy, or loosely curled, coming in a variety of colors and patterns.</p>\n<p>In terms of temperament, Borzois are known for their gentle and calm demeanor. They are intelligent and independent, often displaying a reserved nature, especially around strangers. Despite their hunting heritage, they are affectionate with their families and can be quite sensitive, responding best to gentle training methods.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for coursing and hunting, Borzois possess exceptional speed and agility. Their strong necks and jaws enabled them to chase, catch, and hold their quarry. Today, while they are less commonly used for hunting, they excel in lure coursing and other canine sports that tap into their natural instincts.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Borzois are cherished as companion animals. Their graceful appearance and serene nature have earned them a place in many homes worldwide. However, their independent streak and specific exercise needs mean they are best suited for owners who understand and appreciate the breed's unique characteristics.</p>\n<p>Notable traits of the Borzoi include their sensitivity to anesthesia, a common trait among sighthounds due to their lean body mass. They are also prone to certain health issues like bloat and hip dysplasia, necessitating informed and attentive care from their owners.</p>",
