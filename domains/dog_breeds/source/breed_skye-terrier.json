  "full_description": "<p>The Skye Terrier is a distinctive and elegant breed originating from Scotland's Isle of Skye over 400 years ago. Initially bred by farmers to control vermin, their long, low bodies and sturdy legs made them adept at navigating rocky terrains and burrowing into dens. Their double coat provided protection against harsh weather and underbrush. By the 19th century, the breed gained popularity among British nobility, notably Queen Victoria, who favored the prick-eared variety.</p>\n<p>Physically, Skye Terriers are characterized by their elongated bodies, measuring twice as long as they are tall. They possess a straight, hard topcoat and a soft undercoat, with hair veiling their forehead and eyes. Their ears can be either prick or drop, both types being equally acceptable. Common coat colors include fawn, dark or light silver-grey, and cream, all with black points on the ears, muzzle, and nose.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Skye Terriers are loyal, affectionate, and possess a strong-willed nature. They form deep bonds with their families and can be reserved around strangers. Their independent streak requires patient and consistent training. Historically, they were tenacious hunters, a trait that still influences their behavior today.</p>\n<p>Originally bred to hunt vermin, Skye Terriers were valued for their agility and determination. In modern times, they serve primarily as companion animals, though their rarity has led to concerns about the breed's survival. Efforts are ongoing to preserve this unique breed.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Skye Terrier include their distinctive appearance, unwavering loyalty, and historical significance. Their unique combination of elegance and tenacity makes them a cherished breed among enthusiasts.</p>",
