  "full_description": "<p>The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a large, powerful breed originating from the rugged terrain of Turkey, where it was developed to guard livestock against formidable predators such as wolves and bears. This breed's history dates back thousands of years, with its ancestors serving as vigilant protectors of flocks in the Anatolian region. The Anatolian Shepherd's imposing stature is characterized by a broad, strong head and a dense double coat that varies in length and color, typically ranging from fawn to wolf grey, often accompanied by a black mask. Males stand between 29 to 32 inches tall at the shoulder, while females are slightly smaller, measuring 27 to 31 inches. Their weight ranges from 80 to 150 pounds, with males generally heavier than females. Temperamentally, Anatolian Shepherds are known for their independence, intelligence, and strong protective instincts. They are loyal and affectionate with their families but can be wary of strangers, making early socialization crucial. Their original purpose as livestock guardians endowed them with a natural ability to make decisions independently, a trait that persists today. In modern times, while they continue to serve as livestock guardians, Anatolian Shepherds have also become valued companions and watchdogs in various parts of the world. Their notable characteristics include a calm demeanor, vigilance, and a strong territorial instinct, making them both formidable protectors and devoted family members.</p>",
