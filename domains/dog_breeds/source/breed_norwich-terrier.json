  "full_description": "<p>The Norwich Terrier, originating from East Anglia, England, is one of the smallest working terriers, developed primarily for hunting small rodents. This breed was initially recognized in 1936, with the prick-eared variety designated as the Norwich Terrier and the drop-eared variety as the Norfolk Terrier. Physically, the Norwich Terrier stands approximately 10 inches tall at the withers and weighs around 12 pounds. They possess a hard, wiry double coat that comes in shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle. Their small, dark, oval-shaped eyes and erect, medium-sized ears contribute to their alert and keen expression. Temperamentally, Norwich Terriers are known for their affectionate, fearless, and loyal nature. They are confident and social, bonding closely with their families, making them excellent companions for both individuals and families, including those with children or other pets. Originally bred to hunt small vermin, they are energetic and require daily exercise and mental stimulation. In modern times, they have transitioned into beloved family pets, appreciated for their spirited and stocky build, as well as their agreeable and hardy disposition. Notable characteristics of the breed include their sensitive prick ears, slightly foxy expression, and a natural, weatherproof coat that requires regular grooming to maintain its texture and appearance.</p>",
