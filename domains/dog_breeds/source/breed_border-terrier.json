  "full_description": "<p>The Border Terrier is a small, energetic breed originating from the Anglo-Scottish border region. Developed in the 18th century, these dogs were bred to assist in fox hunting, possessing the agility to keep up with horses and the size to follow foxes into their dens. They share ancestry with the Dandie Dinmont and Bedlington Terriers. Physically, Border Terriers are characterized by their distinctive 'otter head,' with a broad skull and short muzzle. They have a double coat: a dense, soft undercoat and a harsh, wiry outer coat that comes in colors such as red, grizzle and tan, blue and tan, or wheaten. Males typically weigh between 13 to 15.5 pounds and stand about 11 inches tall, while females weigh 11.5 to 14 pounds and stand around 10 inches tall. Temperamentally, Border Terriers are affectionate, intelligent, and eager to please. They are known for their friendly disposition, making them excellent companions for families. Their working heritage endows them with a strong prey drive and a penchant for digging. Originally, they were used to hunt foxes and control vermin, showcasing their determination and agility. In modern times, they excel in various canine sports, including agility and obedience trials, and are cherished as family pets. Notable characteristics include their adaptability to different living environments, moderate grooming needs, and a lifespan of 12 to 15 years.</p>",
