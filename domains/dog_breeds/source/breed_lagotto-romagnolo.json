  "full_description": "<p>The Lagotto Romagnolo is an ancient Italian breed originating from the marshlands of the Romagna region, particularly around the Delta del Po. Historically, these dogs were utilized as water retrievers, adept at retrieving game from the wetlands. With the drainage of these marshes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the breed transitioned to truffle hunting, leveraging their exceptional olfactory abilities. Physically, the Lagotto is a small to medium-sized dog, typically standing between 41 to 48 cm at the withers and weighing 11 to 16 kg. They possess a robust, square-built frame covered in a dense, curly, and wool-like coat that comes in various colors, including off-white, brown, and orange, often with patches or roaning. Their large, round eyes range from dark yellow to brown, exuding an alert and intelligent expression. Temperamentally, Lagottos are affectionate, loyal, and eager to please, making them excellent family companions. They are known for their intelligence and trainability, often excelling in obedience and agility activities. Originally bred for retrieving and later for truffle hunting, they exhibit a strong work ethic and a keen sense of smell. In contemporary times, while they continue to be prized truffle hunters, Lagottos have also gained popularity as companion animals due to their hypoallergenic coats and amiable nature. Notably, they are one of the few breeds specialized in truffle hunting, a testament to their unique combination of olfactory prowess and trainability.</p>",
