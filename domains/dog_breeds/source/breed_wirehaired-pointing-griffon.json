  "full_description": "<p>The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, also known as the Korthals Griffon, is a versatile hunting dog developed in the late 19th century by Dutch breeder Eduard Korthals. Aiming to create an all-terrain hunting companion, Korthals selectively bred dogs with exceptional scenting abilities, strength, endurance, and water-resistant coats. The resulting breed excels in both pointing and retrieving game on land and in water. Physically, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a medium-sized dog with a noble, square-shaped head and a slightly longer-than-tall body proportion. Males typically stand 22 to 24 inches tall, while females range from 20 to 22 inches. Their distinctive double coat consists of a harsh, wiry outer layer and a soft, dense undercoat, providing protection against harsh weather and rough terrain. The coat is commonly steel gray with brown markings, and the breed is known for its expressive facial furnishings, including bushy eyebrows and a prominent mustache. Temperamentally, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are friendly, eager, and quick-witted. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their cooperative nature, making them relatively easy to train. Their original purpose as versatile gundogs required them to work closely with hunters, a trait that translates into a strong desire to please their owners. In the field, they are renowned for their exceptional scenting abilities and adaptability to various terrains, from dense forests to wetlands. In modern times, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon continues to be a favored companion for hunters due to its versatility and reliability. While not as widely popular as some other breeds, it has a dedicated following among enthusiasts who appreciate its unique qualities. Notably, the breed's adaptability and friendly nature have also made it a cherished family pet for active households. Distinctive characteristics of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon include its unkempt appearance due to the wiry coat, webbed toes that aid in swimming, and a strong, muscular build that reflects its working heritage. These features, combined with its amiable disposition and intelligence, contribute to the breed's reputation as the 'supreme gundog.'</p>",
