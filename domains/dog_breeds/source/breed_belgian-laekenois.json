  "full_description": "<p>The Belgian Laekenois, one of the four varieties of Belgian Shepherds, originates from Belgium and is named after the Château de Laeken. Developed primarily for guarding linen drying in fields and herding livestock, this breed has a rich history dating back to the Middle Ages. Physically, the Laekenois is a medium to large-sized dog, standing between 22 to 26 inches tall and weighing approximately 55 to 65 pounds. It possesses a distinctive rough, wiry coat that is reddish fawn with black shading, particularly around the muzzle and tail. The breed's square, athletic build exudes both elegance and strength. Temperamentally, the Laekenois is intelligent, alert, and naturally protective. It forms strong bonds with its family, displaying loyalty and affection, yet remains cautious around strangers. Historically utilized for herding and guarding, the breed's working abilities are evident in its agility and responsiveness. In modern times, while still relatively rare, the Laekenois is gaining recognition as both a working dog and a devoted family companion. Notable characteristics include its keen intelligence, high energy levels, and a strong desire to work, making it well-suited for active households.</p>",
