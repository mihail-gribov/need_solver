  "full_description": "<p>The Welsh Terrier, often referred to as the 'Welshie,' is a breed with deep roots in Wales, dating back to the 1700s. Originally bred for hunting foxes, rodents, and badgers in the rugged terrains of northern Wales, they have evolved into both show dogs and cherished companions. Despite their transition to domestic life, Welsh Terriers have retained their strong hunting instincts and energetic nature. Physically, they are sturdy and compact, standing about 15 inches (38 cm) tall and weighing approximately 20 pounds (9 kg). Their distinctive appearance includes a hard, wiry coat, typically black-and-tan, with wide-set eyes and a flat skull that imparts an intelligent expression. Temperamentally, Welsh Terriers are lively, intelligent, and loyal. They exhibit a friendly and outgoing demeanor, making them excellent family pets. Their energetic disposition necessitates regular exercise to prevent boredom and potential mischief. Historically, their working abilities were honed for hunting small game, and they have maintained a strong prey drive. In modern times, they are appreciated for their companionship and adaptability, fitting well into various family settings. Notable characteristics of the breed include their minimal shedding, making them suitable for individuals with mild allergies, and their resemblance to a smaller version of the Airedale Terrier.</p>",
