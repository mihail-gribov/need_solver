  "full_description": "<p>The Pumi is a medium-sized herding dog originating from Hungary, developed in the 17th and 18th centuries through the crossbreeding of the Puli with German and French herding dogs. This blend resulted in a versatile and agile breed adept at managing livestock in Hungary's varied terrains. Physically, the Pumi presents a square, lean, and muscular build, standing between 15 to 18 inches tall and weighing approximately 22 to 29 pounds. Its distinctive features include a long, narrow head with a tapered muzzle, semi-erect ears that contribute to its alert expression, and a tail carried in a circle over its back. The breed's double coat is medium-length, wavy to curly, and comes in solid colors such as black, white, various shades of gray, and fawn. Pumis are known for their lively and energetic temperament, combining the intelligence of herding breeds with the alertness of terriers. They are quick learners, responsive to training, and maintain a playful demeanor into adulthood. Historically, Pumis were utilized for herding cattle, sheep, and pigs, excelling in driving livestock through narrow paths and dense vegetation. Today, they continue to serve as herding dogs and have gained popularity in dog sports like agility, obedience, and herding trials. Their unique combination of agility, intelligence, and spirited personality makes them well-suited for active families and individuals seeking an engaging companion. Notable characteristics of the Pumi include its expressive, whimsical appearance, high energy levels, and strong herding instincts, which may manifest in behaviors like nipping or attempting to herd people or other animals. Early socialization and consistent training are essential to channel these instincts appropriately. Overall, the Pumi is a dynamic and affectionate breed that thrives in environments where it can engage both mentally and physically.</p>",
