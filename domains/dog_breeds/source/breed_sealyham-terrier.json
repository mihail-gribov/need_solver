  "full_description": "<p>The Sealyham Terrier is a robust and spirited breed originating from Wales in the mid-19th century. Developed by Captain John Edwardes at Sealyham House in Pembrokeshire, the breed was meticulously crafted for hunting small game such as badgers, foxes, and otters. Edwardes aimed to create a small, predominantly white terrier with a strong jaw and wiry coat, ensuring the dog was distinguishable from its quarry during hunts. The exact mix of breeds used remains undocumented, but it's believed that the Welsh Corgi, Fox Terrier (Wire), Dandie Dinmont Terrier, West Highland White Terrier, Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and the now-extinct English White Terrier contributed to the Sealyham's development.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Sealyham Terrier is a small, sturdy dog standing about 10.5 inches (27 cm) at the shoulder and weighing approximately 20 pounds (9 kg) for males and slightly less for females. The breed features a rectangular body, being slightly longer than tall, with a deep chest and well-sprung ribs. Its head is long and broad, with a slightly domed skull and a powerful, square muzzle. The eyes are dark and set wide apart, conveying a keen and alert expression. Ears are moderately large, with rounded tips, folding level with the top of the head. The Sealyham's coat is a distinctive double layer: a hard, wiry outer coat and a dense, soft undercoat, predominantly white, sometimes with lemon, brown, blue, or badger markings on the head and ears.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Sealyham Terriers are known for their lively and alert nature, yet they are more docile compared to other terrier breeds. They exhibit a playful and friendly demeanor, showing complete devotion to their human families. While they are affectionate and enjoy companionship, they can be reserved towards strangers and may display a strong prey drive, leading them to chase small animals. Early socialization is crucial to ensure they are well-mannered and adaptable.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for hunting and pest control, Sealyhams were adept at going to ground after badgers and accompanying Otterhounds on hunts. Their strong build and fearless nature made them excellent working dogs. In modern times, while their hunting roles have diminished, they have transitioned into cherished family companions and show dogs. Despite their historical popularity, the breed has seen a decline in numbers and is now considered a vulnerable native breed.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Sealyham Terrier include their distinctive white, wiry coat, which requires regular grooming to maintain its texture and prevent matting. They possess a strong, muscular build that belies their small stature, and their expressive facial features, including bushy eyebrows and a prominent beard, add to their unique appearance. Their adaptable nature allows them to thrive in various living environments, from city apartments to rural homes, as long as their exercise and companionship needs are met.</p>",
