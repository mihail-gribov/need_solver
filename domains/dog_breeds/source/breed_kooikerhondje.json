  "full_description": "<p>The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje, pronounced 'Netherlands-e Coy-ker-hond-tsje,' is a small, spaniel-type breed originating from the Netherlands in the 16th century. Developed as a duck decoy dog, it played a crucial role in the traditional hunting method known as 'Eendenkooi,' where the dog's lively movements and distinctive tail lured ducks into traps. This breed was also favored by Dutch nobility and frequently depicted in paintings by artists like Rembrandt and Vermeer. By the mid-20th century, the Kooikerhondje faced near extinction but was revived through dedicated breeding programs, notably by Baroness van Hardenbroek van Ammerstol in the 1940s. The American Kennel Club (AKC) officially recognized the breed in 2018.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Kooikerhondje is harmoniously built with almost square body proportions. Males typically stand at 16 inches tall, while females are about 15 inches. They possess a medium-length, water-repellent double coat with distinctive orange-red patches on a white background. The well-feathered tail is carried level with or above the topline, and the ears, set above eye level, often feature black tips known as 'earrings.'</p>\n<p>In terms of temperament, the Kooikerhondje is lively, agile, and self-confident. They are good-natured and alert, forming strong bonds with their families. While friendly and easy-going with familiar people, they can be reserved around strangers. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, though their sensitive nature requires gentle training methods.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for duck decoy work, the Kooikerhondje's agility and attentiveness made it adept at luring ducks into traps. Today, while no longer commonly used for hunting, they excel in various dog sports, including agility, obedience, and scent work. Their versatility and cheerful character have also made them cherished companions worldwide.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive 'earrings,' the black tips on their ears, and their fox-like appearance, which historically played a role in their hunting technique. Their well-feathered, waving tail is another hallmark, used historically to attract ducks and now a charming feature in companionship.</p>",
