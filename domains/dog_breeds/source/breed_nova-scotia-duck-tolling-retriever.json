  "name": "Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever",
  "full_description": "<p>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, commonly known as the Toller, originated in the early 19th century in the Little River district of Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia, Canada. Developed to lure and retrieve waterfowl, the breed's unique hunting method involves the dog playing along the shoreline to attract the curiosity of ducks, drawing them within range for hunters.</p>\n<p>Physically, Tollers are medium-sized, powerful, and compact, making them the smallest of the retriever breeds. Males typically stand between 18 to 21 inches at the withers, while females range from 17 to 20 inches. They possess a water-repellent double coat of medium length, varying in shades from golden red to dark copper, often with lighter featherings and white markings on the tail tip, feet, chest, or blaze.</p>\n<p>In terms of temperament, Tollers are intelligent, outgoing, and affectionate. They exhibit a playful demeanor and are known for their high energy levels. Their strong retrieving instinct and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, though they can display a mix of stubbornness and sensitivity, requiring consistent and positive training methods.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for tolling and retrieving waterfowl, Tollers are adept swimmers with webbed feet and a strong desire to work. Their agility and endurance have made them versatile in various canine sports and activities. In modern times, they serve as both hunting companions and family pets, participating in activities such as obedience, agility, and search and rescue. Their adaptability and friendly nature have contributed to their growing popularity among active families and outdoor enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their unique tolling behavior, where their playful actions lure waterfowl, and their distinctive high-pitched bark, often referred to as the \"Toller scream,\" which they emit when excited. Additionally, their compact size combined with their strength and agility sets them apart from other retriever breeds.</p>",
