  "full_description": "<p>The Treeing Walker Coonhound is a distinguished American breed renowned for its exceptional hunting prowess and amiable disposition. Originating in the United States during the 19th century, this breed was developed by crossing English Foxhounds with native American hounds, aiming to create a dog adept at tracking and treeing game, particularly raccoons. The breed's name reflects its primary function: 'treeing' refers to its ability to chase prey up trees, while 'Walker' honors Thomas Walker, a key figure in the breed's development. Physically, the Treeing Walker Coonhound is a medium to large-sized dog, with males standing between 22 to 27 inches and females between 20 to 25 inches at the shoulder. They typically weigh between 50 to 70 pounds. Their coat is short, dense, and glossy, providing protection against rough terrain. The breed's coloration is predominantly tricolor—white with black and tan markings—though bicolor variations are also accepted. Notable physical features include a broad skull, long, hanging ears, and large, dark eyes that convey a gentle expression. Temperamentally, Treeing Walker Coonhounds are intelligent, energetic, and affectionate. They exhibit a strong desire to please, making them relatively easy to train, though their independent nature may require consistent guidance. Their original purpose as hunting dogs endowed them with remarkable endurance and a keen sense of smell, traits that remain evident today. In contemporary settings, while they continue to excel in hunting, they have also become cherished family companions. Their friendly and sociable nature makes them well-suited to active households that can provide ample exercise and mental stimulation. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive 'bugle' bark, which they use to alert hunters when game is treed, and their exceptional tracking abilities, which have earned them a reputation as one of the most reliable coonhounds.</p>",
