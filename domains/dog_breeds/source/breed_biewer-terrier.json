  "full_description": "<p>The Biewer Terrier is a charming and elegant toy breed that originated in Germany in the 1980s. Developed by breeders Werner and Gertrude Biewer, this breed emerged when two Yorkshire Terriers carrying a recessive piebald gene produced tricolor puppies. Captivated by their unique appearance, the Biewers dedicated themselves to refining and establishing the breed, which was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2021.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Biewer Terrier is a small, fine to medium-boned dog, standing between 7 to 11 inches tall and weighing 4 to 8 pounds. Its long, flowing, silky coat is straight and without an undercoat, parting down the middle and hanging evenly on both sides. The breed's distinctive tricolor pattern includes combinations of blue/black, gold/tan, and white, with specific color distributions on the head and body. The tail is set high, carried over the back in a teacup handle fashion, and adorned with a long, luxurious plume.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Biewer Terriers are intelligent, loyal, and devoted companions. They exhibit a fun-loving, childlike attitude, making them suitable for families and individuals alike. Their friendly disposition extends to other animals, and they are known for their sociable nature. While they can be mischievous at times, they are generally obedient and eager to please.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as companion animals, Biewer Terriers have no specific working abilities. Their primary purpose has always been to provide companionship, and they excel in this role due to their affectionate and playful nature. In modern times, their popularity has grown, especially after gaining recognition from major kennel clubs. They are cherished for their unique appearance and delightful personalities, making them a favored choice among toy breed enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Biewer Terrier include their distinctive tricolor coat, elegant appearance, and friendly demeanor. Their long, silky hair requires regular grooming to maintain its beauty and health. Despite their small size, they possess a confident and graceful movement, reflecting their spirited nature.</p>",
