  "full_description": "<p>The Cairn Terrier is a small, hardy breed originating from the Scottish Highlands and the Isle of Skye. Developed in the 17th century, these dogs were bred to control vermin populations threatening game on farms. Their name derives from 'cairns,' the stone piles common in the highlands, where they would flush out rodents. Physically, Cairn Terriers are compact and agile, standing approximately 28-31 cm (11-12 inches) tall and weighing between 6-7.5 kg (14-16 lbs). They possess a double coat: a harsh, weather-resistant outer layer and a soft undercoat, which can be cream, wheaten, red, grey, or nearly black, often with brindling. Their expressive eyes are dark hazel, set wide apart beneath shaggy eyebrows, and their small, pointed ears stand erect. Temperamentally, Cairns are fearless, assertive, and cheerful, embodying a 'gay disposition.' They are intelligent and curious, making them quick learners but sometimes stubborn. Originally, they excelled in hunting small prey, showcasing remarkable persistence and tenacity. Today, they are cherished as family companions, known for their affectionate nature and adaptability to various living environments. Notably, a Cairn Terrier named Toto gained fame in 'The Wizard of Oz,' highlighting the breed's enduring appeal.</p>",
