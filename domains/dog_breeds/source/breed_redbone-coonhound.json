  "name": "Redbone Coonhound",
  "full_description": "<p>The Redbone Coonhound is an American breed of hunting dog, renowned for its striking solid red coat and exceptional hunting abilities. Originating in the Southern United States before the Civil War, the breed was developed by crossing red-colored foxhounds brought by Scottish immigrants with Bloodhounds and possibly Irish hounds. This selective breeding aimed to create a versatile hunter capable of tracking and treeing raccoons, as well as larger game like bears and cougars.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Redbone Coonhound is a medium to large-sized dog with a lean, muscular build. Males typically stand between 22 to 27 inches at the shoulder, while females range from 21 to 26 inches. Their weight is proportionate to their size, generally between 45 to 85 pounds. The breed's short, smooth coat is a rich, deep red, occasionally featuring small white markings on the chest or feet. They possess long, floppy ears and dark brown to hazel eyes that convey a pleading expression.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Redbone Coonhounds are friendly, sociable, and eager to please. They are known for their even-tempered nature and strong desire to be part of family activities. While they are affectionate and gentle with family members, their high energy levels and strong hunting instincts necessitate regular exercise and mental stimulation.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for hunting raccoons, Redbone Coonhounds have a natural treeing instinct, meaning they are adept at chasing prey up trees and alerting hunters with their distinctive baying. Their agility and endurance make them proficient in various terrains, from swamps to mountainous regions. In modern times, while they continue to be valued as hunting companions, they have also gained popularity as family pets due to their loyal and affectionate nature.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Redbone Coonhound include their striking red coat, exceptional hunting skills, and a sweet, melodious voice that carries over long distances. They are also recognized for their versatility, being capable of hunting both small and large game, and their adaptability to different environments.</p>",
