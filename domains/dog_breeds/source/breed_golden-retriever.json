  "full_description": "<p>The Golden Retriever is a medium to large-sized breed renowned for its friendly disposition, intelligence, and striking golden coat. Originating in Scotland during the late 19th century, the breed was developed by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, later known as Lord Tweedmouth. Aiming to create the ideal retriever suited for the Scottish Highlands' rugged terrain and wet conditions, he crossbred a yellow Wavy-Coated Retriever named Nous with a Tweed Water Spaniel named Belle. Subsequent infusions of Bloodhound, Irish Setter, and more Tweed Water Spaniels refined the breed, resulting in the versatile and affable Golden Retriever we know today. Recognized by the Kennel Club in 1913, the breed quickly gained popularity across the globe.</p>\n<p>Physically, Golden Retrievers exhibit a symmetrical and balanced build. Males typically stand between 23 to 24 inches (58 to 61 cm) at the withers, while females range from 21.5 to 22.5 inches (55 to 57 cm). Their weight varies, with males weighing between 65 to 75 pounds (29 to 34 kg) and females between 55 to 65 pounds (25 to 29 kg). The breed's most distinctive feature is its dense, water-repellent double coat, which can be wavy or straight and comes in various shades of gold. Feathering is present on the neck, legs, thighs, underside, and tail, adding to their elegant appearance.</p>\n<p>Golden Retrievers are celebrated for their gentle and friendly temperament. They are intelligent, eager to please, and highly trainable, making them excellent companions for families. Their patience and tolerance make them particularly good with children. While they are sociable and generally get along well with other animals, their friendly nature means they are not typically effective as guard dogs.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for retrieving game during hunting, Golden Retrievers possess a strong instinct to retrieve and an excellent sense of smell. These traits have made them invaluable in various working roles, including search and rescue, detection, and as guide dogs for the visually impaired. Their versatility and adaptability have contributed to their enduring popularity.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Golden Retrievers are among the most popular dog breeds worldwide. They excel in various canine sports, including obedience, agility, and field trials. Their friendly nature and intelligence also make them ideal therapy and assistance dogs. Notable Golden Retrievers include Liberty, the pet of U.S. President Gerald Ford, and Buddy, the canine actor from the 'Air Bud' film series.</p>\n<p>Distinctive characteristics of the breed include their 'soft mouth,' allowing them to carry game without damage, and their love for water, stemming from their origins as waterfowl retrievers. Their expressive eyes and ever-wagging tails further endear them to dog lovers everywhere.</p>",
