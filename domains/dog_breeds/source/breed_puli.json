  "full_description": "<p>The Puli is a medium-sized Hungarian herding dog renowned for its distinctive corded coat, which resembles dreadlocks. This breed's origins trace back over a thousand years to the Magyar tribes who brought their sheepdogs to Hungary. The Puli was primarily developed for herding and guarding livestock, particularly sheep, on the expansive Hungarian plains. Its agility, intelligence, and resilience made it an invaluable asset to shepherds. Physically, the Puli stands approximately 16 to 17 inches tall at the withers and weighs between 25 to 35 pounds. Its most striking feature is its dense, weather-resistant coat that naturally forms cords. This coat can be black, white, gray, or a shade of fawn, with black being the most common. The Puli's eyes are dark brown, and its ears are medium-sized and V-shaped, hanging down close to the head. The tail curls over the back, blending seamlessly with the profuse coat. Temperamentally, the Puli is energetic, intelligent, and affectionate. It forms strong bonds with its family and is known for its loyalty and protective nature. This breed is alert and can be wary of strangers, making it an excellent watchdog. Its herding instincts are strong, and it often exhibits a desire to control the movements of people and other animals. Historically, the Puli was bred for herding and guarding livestock. Its agility and quick reflexes allowed it to manage flocks efficiently, while its protective nature ensured the safety of the herd. In modern times, while some Pulik still work as herding dogs, many have transitioned into companion roles. They excel in various canine sports, including agility, obedience, and herding trials, showcasing their versatility and intelligence. Notable characteristics of the Puli include its unique corded coat, which provides protection against harsh weather and potential predators. This breed is also known for its agility and distinctive, light-footed movement, often described as a bouncing trot. The Puli's keen intelligence and problem-solving abilities make it both a delightful companion and a capable working dog.</p>",
