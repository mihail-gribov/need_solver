  "name": "German Shepherd Dog",
  "full_description": "<p>The German Shepherd Dog (GSD), also known as the Alsatian, originated in Germany in the late 19th century. Developed by Captain Max von Stephanitz in 1899, the breed was created by selectively breeding herding dogs from central and southern Germany to produce a versatile working dog with intelligence, strength, and obedience. The Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (SV) was established to oversee the breed's development and standardization.</p>\n<p>Physically, German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs with a well-muscled, slightly elongated body. Males typically stand between 60 to 65 cm at the withers, while females range from 55 to 60 cm. They possess a double coat, with the outer layer being dense and straight, and the undercoat soft and thick. Common coat colors include black and tan, sable, and solid black. Their ears are large and erect, and they have a bushy tail that reaches the hock.</p>\n<p>German Shepherds are renowned for their intelligence, loyalty, and confidence. They are eager to learn and highly trainable, making them suitable for various roles. Their temperament is balanced, exhibiting both protective instincts and a friendly demeanor when properly socialized.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for herding sheep, German Shepherds have demonstrated exceptional working abilities. Their keen sense of smell, agility, and intelligence have made them invaluable in roles such as police and military work, search and rescue operations, and as service dogs for individuals with disabilities.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the German Shepherd remains one of the most popular and versatile dog breeds worldwide. Their adaptability allows them to excel in various environments, from family companions to working dogs in specialized fields. Their notable characteristics include a strong work ethic, unwavering loyalty, and a protective nature, making them both dependable partners and beloved family members.</p>",
