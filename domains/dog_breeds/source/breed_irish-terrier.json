  "name": "Irish Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Irish Terrier, one of the oldest terrier breeds, originated in Ireland and was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1885. Initially bred as an all-purpose farm dog, they excelled in hunting vermin, guarding properties, and serving as loyal companions. During World War I, Irish Terriers demonstrated their bravery by acting as messengers in the trenches, showcasing their intelligence and courage.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Irish Terrier presents a racy, graceful outline, combining speed and endurance with power. They are medium-sized dogs, typically standing between 18 to 20 inches tall and weighing around 25 to 27 pounds. Their dense, wiry, and broken coat ranges in color from red to wheaten, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. The breed's head is long and narrow, with small, dark eyes that exude an intense expression, and small, V-shaped ears that fold forward.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Irish Terriers are fearless, fun-loving, and possess a mind of their own. They are extremely loyal and affectionate with their families, often forming strong bonds with their owners. While they are good-tempered and gentle pets, they can be tenacious and may not always get along with other dogs. Their high energy levels and intelligence require regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and potential mischief.</p>\n<p>Historically, Irish Terriers were versatile working dogs, adept at hunting foxes, otters, and other small mammals. Their keen senses and agility made them excellent hunters and reliable farm dogs. In modern times, they have transitioned into beloved family companions, known for their loyalty and spirited nature. Although their popularity has declined since the early 20th century, they remain cherished by enthusiasts who appreciate their unique characteristics.</p>\n<p>Notable for their adaptability, Irish Terriers can thrive in various environments, provided they receive adequate exercise and mental engagement. Their minimal grooming needs and robust health make them relatively low-maintenance compared to other breeds. However, their strong-willed nature necessitates consistent, positive reinforcement training from an early age to ensure they develop into well-mannered adults.</p>",
