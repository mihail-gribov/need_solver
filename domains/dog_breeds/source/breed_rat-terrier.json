  "full_description": "<p>The Rat Terrier is an American breed developed in the early 19th century by crossing Smooth Fox Terriers, Old English White Terriers, Bull Terriers, and Manchester Terriers. Later, Chihuahuas, Toy Fox Terriers, and Feist breeds were incorporated to enhance specific traits. In the 1910s and 1920s, to address rabbit infestations in the Midwest, farmers bred Rat Terriers with Whippets and Italian Greyhounds for increased speed, while those in the Central and Southern regions introduced Beagle lineage to enhance prey drive and scenting abilities.</p>\n<p>Physically, Rat Terriers are small to medium-sized dogs with a well-muscled, compact build. They possess a deep chest, strong shoulders, solid neck, and powerful legs. Their ears can be upright, button, or tipped, and they may have short or full-length tails, either left natural or docked. The coat is short, smooth, and requires minimal grooming.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Rat Terriers are loyal, energetic, and intelligent. They are playful and generally good with children, though they may be reserved with strangers. Their strong prey drive makes them excellent hunters, but they can be scrappy with other dogs and may not be suitable around small pets, especially rodents.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for farm work, Rat Terriers excelled in hunting rodents and vermin both above and below ground. They are capable of trailing, flushing, and treeing game, as well as hunting rabbits. Their versatility made them invaluable on farms, with one Rat Terrier reportedly killing over 2,500 rats in a seven-hour span in an infested barn.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Rat Terriers have transitioned from farm dogs to beloved companions. They are recognized by major kennel clubs, including the United Kennel Club (UKC) in 1999 and the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2013. Their adaptability and intelligence make them suitable for various dog sports and activities, such as agility, obedience, and barn hunt competitions.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Rat Terrier include their versatility, strong prey drive, and affectionate nature. They are known for their speed, agility, and keen hunting instincts, making them both excellent working dogs and loyal family companions.</p>",
