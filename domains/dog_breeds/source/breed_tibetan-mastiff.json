  "full_description": "<p>The Tibetan Mastiff, known as Do-Khyi in its native land, is an ancient breed originating from the Himalayan region. Historically, these formidable dogs served as guardians for Tibetan villages, nomadic encampments, and monasteries, protecting inhabitants and livestock from predators and intruders. Their lineage dates back to antiquity, with some accounts suggesting they are the progenitors of many modern large working breeds. Physically, the Tibetan Mastiff is a large, powerfully built dog with a noble and dignified appearance. Males typically stand between 26 to 29 inches at the shoulder, while females are slightly smaller. Their weight ranges from 70 to 150 pounds, with males being heavier. They possess a broad head, deep-set almond-shaped eyes, and a well-feathered tail that curls over the back. Their dense double coat, which can be black, brown, gray, or gold, provides insulation against harsh climates. Temperamentally, Tibetan Mastiffs are known for their independence, intelligence, and strong-willed nature. They are deeply loyal to their families but can be aloof and wary of strangers, making them excellent guardians. Their protective instincts are deeply ingrained, and they are known to be territorial. Originally bred to guard livestock and property, they excelled in deterring predators and intruders. In modern times, while they still serve as guardians, they have also become companion animals for those who appreciate their unique characteristics. Notable traits include their deep, resonant bark, which serves as a deterrent to potential threats, and their seasonal shedding, which requires regular grooming.</p>",
