  "full_description": "<p>The American Water Spaniel (AWS) is a versatile and energetic breed developed in the United States during the 19th century, primarily in the Midwest regions along the Fox and Wolf Rivers in Wisconsin. Hunters sought a compact, all-around hunting dog capable of retrieving game from both land and water, even in challenging conditions. The AWS was likely developed from a mix of breeds, including the Irish Water Spaniel, English Water Spaniel, Curly-Coated Retriever, and possibly native Indian dogs. Official recognition came from the United Kennel Club in 1920 and the American Kennel Club in 1940. Physically, the AWS is a medium-sized, muscular dog standing between 15 to 18 inches (38 to 45 cm) tall and weighing 25 to 45 pounds (11 to 20 kg). Its distinctive double coat is dense and water-resistant, featuring tight curls or a marcel pattern (uniform waves) in liver, brown, or dark chocolate colors. Some individuals may have small white markings on the chest and toes. The breed's broad skull, hanging ears covered with curls, and expressive eyes contribute to its alert and friendly appearance. Temperamentally, the AWS is intelligent, eager to please, and known for its friendly disposition. It forms strong bonds with family members and is generally good with children and other pets. While affectionate, the breed can be reserved around strangers and may exhibit a protective nature. Originally bred for hunting, the AWS excels in retrieving waterfowl and flushing game birds, demonstrating remarkable endurance and versatility in various terrains. Today, the breed continues to participate in hunting activities and has also found roles in agility, obedience, and as a loyal family companion. Despite its capabilities, the AWS remains relatively rare, with an estimated 3,000 individuals primarily located in the Midwestern United States. Notably, it was designated the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. Distinctive characteristics of the AWS include its unique curly coat, exceptional swimming ability, and adaptability to both land and water environments. Its compact size and energetic nature make it suitable for active families and hunters seeking a versatile and devoted companion.</p>",
