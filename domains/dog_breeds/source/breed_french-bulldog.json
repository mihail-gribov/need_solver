  "name": "French Bulldog",
  "full_description": "<p>The French Bulldog, affectionately known as the 'Frenchie,' is a small, muscular dog with a smooth coat, compact build, and distinctive 'bat ears.' Originating in the 19th century, the breed was developed by lace workers in Nottingham, England, who migrated to France during the Industrial Revolution, bringing their small bulldogs with them. These dogs were then crossed with local breeds, resulting in the French Bulldog we know today.</p>\n<p>Physically, French Bulldogs are compact and muscular, typically weighing under 28 pounds. They have a short, smooth coat that comes in various colors, including brindle, fawn, cream, and white with brindle patches. Their most notable feature is their large, upright 'bat ears,' which contribute to their alert and expressive appearance.</p>\n<p>In terms of temperament, Frenchies are known for their affectionate and friendly nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are particularly good with children. Their playful and adaptable disposition makes them suitable for various living situations, from apartments to larger homes. While they are intelligent, they can also be a bit stubborn, which may require patience during training.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as companion animals, French Bulldogs have never been used for traditional working roles. Their primary purpose has always been to provide companionship, a role they continue to excel in today. Their popularity has surged in recent years, with the breed ranking as the most popular dog in the United States in 2024.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the French Bulldog include their brachycephalic (short-nosed) facial structure, which contributes to their unique appearance but also predisposes them to certain health issues. Their compact size and moderate exercise needs make them ideal for urban living. However, potential owners should be aware of their sensitivity to heat and the importance of regular health check-ups to monitor for breed-specific health concerns.</p>",
