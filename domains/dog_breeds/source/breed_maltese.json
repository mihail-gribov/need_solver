  "full_description": "<p>The Maltese is an ancient toy breed, renowned for its long, silky white coat and affectionate nature. Originating over 2,000 years ago, the breed's exact beginnings are shrouded in history, but it is widely believed that the Phoenicians introduced these small dogs to Malta, where they became cherished companions. Greek and Roman aristocrats highly valued the Maltese, often depicting them in art and literature. Aristotle even referred to them as \"perfectly proportioned\" despite their diminutive size. Throughout the centuries, the Maltese has maintained its status as a beloved lapdog, symbolizing elegance and refinement.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Maltese is a small, compact dog with a proud carriage. Males typically stand between 8.25 to 10 inches at the withers, while females range from 7.5 to 9 inches. Their weight generally falls between 6 to 8 pounds. The breed's hallmark is its long, straight, silky white coat that drapes over the body, often reaching the ground. This luxurious coat lacks an undercoat, contributing to its fine texture. The Maltese's head is slightly rounded, with a well-defined stop and a muzzle that is slightly shorter than the skull. Their dark, oval eyes exude a gentle yet alert expression, and their ears are set high, hanging close to the head with long feathering that blends seamlessly with the rest of the coat.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, the Maltese is lively, intelligent, and affectionate. They form strong bonds with their families and thrive on human companionship. Despite their small size, they possess a spirited and playful demeanor, often displaying a charming and endearing personality. Historically bred as companion animals, Maltese dogs excel in providing comfort and companionship. Their alertness also makes them effective watchdogs, as they are quick to sound the alarm when unfamiliar situations arise. In modern times, the Maltese continues to be a popular choice for those seeking a devoted and elegant companion. Their adaptability allows them to thrive in various living environments, from apartments to larger homes. Regular grooming is essential to maintain their coat's pristine condition, and they benefit from daily exercise to keep them mentally and physically stimulated. Notable characteristics of the Maltese include their hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally, making them suitable for allergy sufferers. Their long lifespan, often exceeding 12 years, allows for many years of companionship. Additionally, their keen intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, excelling in obedience and agility activities.</p>",
