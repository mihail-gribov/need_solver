  "full_description": "<p>The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a medium-sized, solidly built dog with a short, smooth coat and well-defined musculature. Originating in the United States in the late 19th century, the breed was developed from a mix of Old English Bulldogs and Old English Terriers, aiming to combine the strength and tenacity of the bulldog with the agility and gameness of the terrier. Historically, APBTs were bred for bull-baiting and later for dog fighting, but over time, they transitioned into roles as farm dogs and family companions. Physically, the APBT exhibits a broad, flat skull with a wide, deep muzzle. Their eyes are round to almond-shaped, and their ears are small to medium in size, set high on the head, and may be natural or cropped. The tail is relatively short, set low, thick at the base, and tapers to a point. The breed's coat is glossy, smooth, short, and stiff to the touch, coming in all colors and color patterns except merle. Males typically stand between 18–21 inches (45–53 cm) at the withers and weigh around 35–60 pounds (15–27 kg), while females are slightly smaller, standing 17–20 inches (43–50 cm) tall and weighing 30–50 pounds (13–22 kg). Temperamentally, APBTs are known for their strength, confidence, and eagerness to please. They are affectionate, joyful dogs that form strong bonds with their families and are particularly loving and protective around children. Their friendly nature often extends to strangers, making them less suitable as guard dogs. The breed's natural agility and intelligence make them excel in various performance events, including weight pulling, agility, flyball, and obedience competitions. In modern times, APBTs serve as companion animals and working dogs in roles such as search and rescue, police work, and therapy. Notable characteristics of the breed include their athleticism, loyalty, and versatility. However, it's important to note that the breed has faced breed-specific legislation in various countries and regions due to concerns about aggression, often stemming from irresponsible ownership and lack of proper training and socialization.</p>",
