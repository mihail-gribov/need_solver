  "full_description": "<p>The Shiba Inu is an ancient breed originating from Japan, where it was developed for hunting small game such as birds and rabbits in the mountainous regions. Archaeological evidence suggests that dogs resembling the Shiba Inu existed in Japan over 5,000 years ago, making it one of the oldest and most primitive dog breeds. The breed's name translates to \"brushwood dog,\" possibly referring to the terrain where it hunted or the color of its coat. During the Meiji Restoration, the influx of Western dog breeds led to crossbreeding, threatening the purity of native breeds. Efforts to preserve the Shiba Inu intensified in the early 20th century, and despite near extinction during World War II due to food shortages and disease, dedicated breeding programs successfully revived the breed. Today, the Shiba Inu is the most popular companion dog in Japan and has gained significant popularity worldwide.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Shiba Inu is a small, well-proportioned dog with a compact and muscular build. Males typically stand between 35 to 43 cm (13.5 to 16.5 inches) tall at the shoulder, while females range from 33 to 41 cm (13 to 16 inches). Their weight varies from 8 to 10 kg (17 to 23 pounds). The breed's double coat consists of a stiff, straight outer layer and a soft, dense undercoat, providing insulation against various weather conditions. Coat colors include red, black and tan, sesame (a mix of red with black-tipped hairs), and cream. A distinctive feature is the \"urajiro,\" a cream to white ventral coloration present on the sides of the muzzle, cheeks, inside the ears, under the jaw and neck, on the abdomen, and the ventral side of the tail.</p>\n<p>The Shiba Inu's temperament is often described as alert, intelligent, and independent. They are known for their spirited personality and strong-willed nature, which can sometimes be mistaken for stubbornness. Early socialization and consistent, positive reinforcement training are essential to harness their intelligence and ensure they develop into well-mannered companions. While they form strong bonds with their families, Shiba Inus can be reserved around strangers and may exhibit a high prey drive, making them less suitable for homes with small pets unless properly socialized.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for hunting, the Shiba Inu possesses keen senses and agility, traits that made them excellent at flushing out small game in dense underbrush. Their independent nature was advantageous in hunting scenarios, allowing them to make quick decisions in the field. In modern times, while they are primarily kept as companion animals, these traits contribute to their alertness and make them excellent watchdogs. Their popularity has surged globally, partly due to their fox-like appearance and expressive faces, which have made them internet sensations.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Shiba Inu include their cleanliness and fastidious grooming habits, often likened to those of cats. They are known for the \"Shiba scream,\" a high-pitched vocalization emitted when they are unhappy or overly excited. Despite their small size, they have a bold and confident demeanor, often displaying a fearless attitude. Their loyalty to their owners is profound, but they also value their independence, making them unique companions who balance affection with autonomy.</p>",
