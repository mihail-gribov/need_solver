  "full_description": "<p>The Pyrenean Shepherd, also known as the Berger des Pyrénées, is a small to medium-sized herding dog originating from the Pyrenees Mountains in southern France. This breed has been integral to sheep and goat herding in the region for centuries, with evidence suggesting their presence as early as 4000 B.C.. Traditionally, they worked alongside the larger Pyrenean Mountain Dog, with the Shepherds herding the flocks and the Mountain Dogs guarding them. Physically, the Pyrenean Shepherd exhibits a lean, athletic build, allowing for agility and endurance. There are two primary coat varieties: Rough-Faced and Smooth-Faced. Rough-Faced dogs have long or demi-long coats, while Smooth-Faced dogs possess shorter hair on the face and body. Coat colors include fawn, grey, blue merle, slate blue, brindle, black, or black and white. The breed's expressive triangular head and lively eyes reflect its intelligent and alert nature. Temperamentally, Pyrenean Shepherds are energetic, intelligent, and playful. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty and protective instincts. Their high energy levels and quick-wittedness make them excellent working dogs, but they also require regular mental and physical stimulation. Historically, these dogs were bred for herding, capable of managing large flocks over challenging terrains. Their agility and stamina made them invaluable to shepherds. In modern times, while they continue to serve as herding dogs, they have also gained popularity in dog sports such as agility and obedience, showcasing their versatility. Notably, during World War I, Pyrenean Shepherds were utilized as couriers and search-and-rescue dogs, highlighting their bravery and intelligence. Today, they remain a cherished breed, appreciated for their working abilities and companionship.</p>",
