  "full_description": "<p>The Finnish Spitz, known as Suomenpystykorva in its native Finland, is a breed with deep historical roots tracing back approximately 3,000 years. Originally brought to Finland by migrating tribes from central Russia, these dogs were primarily utilized for hunting a variety of game, ranging from small rodents to large predators like bears. Their primary hunting method involved 'bark pointing,' where the dog would locate game and bark to alert the hunter, a technique still valued in modern hunting practices. By the late 19th century, the breed faced near extinction due to crossbreeding. However, dedicated efforts by Finnish enthusiasts, notably Hugo Roos, led to the revival and standardization of the breed by 1892. Physically, the Finnish Spitz presents a fox-like appearance with a square, well-balanced body. Males typically stand between 17.5 to 20 inches tall, while females range from 15.5 to 18 inches. Their weight varies from 22 to 35 pounds, depending on gender. The breed boasts a dense double coat with a soft undercoat and longer, harsh guard hairs, predominantly in shades of golden-red. Notably, puppies are often born with darker coats that lighten as they mature. Temperamentally, Finnish Spitzes are lively, alert, and friendly. They form strong bonds with their families and are particularly good with children, often displaying patience and playfulness. While they are affectionate with familiar faces, they can be reserved around strangers, making them effective watchdogs. Their independent nature, combined with intelligence, means they respond best to positive reinforcement training methods. Historically bred for hunting, their keen senses and barking ability made them adept at locating and signaling the presence of game. In contemporary settings, while they still participate in hunting, many Finnish Spitzes serve as companion animals, cherished for their loyalty and spirited demeanor. The breed holds the esteemed title of Finland's national dog since 1979, reflecting its cultural significance. Notable characteristics include their distinctive barking, capable of reaching up to 160 barks per minute, a trait celebrated in Finnish barking competitions. Their fox-like expression, combined with their vibrant coat and curled tail, adds to their unique charm.</p>",
