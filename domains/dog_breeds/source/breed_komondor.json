  "full_description": "<p>The Komondor, also known as the Hungarian Sheepdog, is a large, powerfully built breed renowned for its distinctive corded white coat. Originating from Hungary, the Komondor's ancestors are believed to have arrived with the migrating Cumans, a Turkic-speaking nomadic people, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The breed's primary role was to guard livestock, particularly sheep, from predators such as wolves. The earliest written mention of the Komondor dates back to 1544, highlighting its longstanding presence in Hungarian culture. Physically, the Komondor is imposing, with males standing at least 27.5 inches (70 cm) tall and females at least 25.5 inches (65 cm). Males typically weigh between 110 to 132 pounds (50 to 60 kg), while females range from 88 to 110 pounds (40 to 50 kg). The breed's most striking feature is its dense, corded coat, which serves as camouflage among sheep and provides protection against harsh weather and predator attacks. This coat requires meticulous care to maintain its unique appearance and functionality. Temperamentally, the Komondor is calm, steady, and highly protective. Bred to work independently, they possess strong guarding instincts and are naturally wary of strangers. However, they are affectionate and loyal to their families, often forming strong bonds with children and other household members. Their original purpose as livestock guardians has transitioned into roles such as property protection and companionship. Despite their working origins, Komondors can adapt to family life, provided they receive proper training and socialization. Notable characteristics of the breed include their independence, intelligence, and unwavering loyalty. Their unique appearance and protective nature make them both a visual and functional standout among dog breeds.</p>",
