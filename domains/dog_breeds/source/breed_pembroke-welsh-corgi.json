  "full_description": "<p>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a small, sturdy herding dog originating from Pembrokeshire, Wales. Historically, they were bred to herd cattle, utilizing their low stature to nip at the heels of livestock while avoiding kicks. This breed is characterized by a foxy head, erect ears, and a medium-length, weather-resistant double coat that comes in colors such as red, sable, fawn, and black and tan, often with white markings. They typically stand 10 to 12 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh between 24 to 30 pounds. Pembrokes are known for their intelligent and affectionate nature, making them excellent companions. They are energetic and require regular exercise to maintain their health and happiness. Their herding instincts may manifest in behaviors like nipping at heels, especially in young dogs. In modern times, Pembroke Welsh Corgis have gained popularity as family pets and have been notably favored by British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth II. Their combination of intelligence, loyalty, and manageable size contributes to their enduring appeal.</p>",
