  "name": "Basset Hound",
  "full_description": "<p>The Basset Hound is a distinctive breed originating from France, developed primarily for hunting small game such as rabbits and hares. Their name derives from the French word 'bas,' meaning 'low,' reflecting their short stature. Basset Hounds are renowned for their exceptional sense of smell, second only to the Bloodhound, making them adept at ground-scenting. Physically, they possess a large, well-proportioned head with a length from occiput to muzzle greater than the width at the brow. Their long, velvety ears help stir up ground scents, and their loose, wrinkled skin around the neck, known as the dewlap, contributes to their characteristic sad expression. They have a short, dense coat that comes in various hound colors, including tricolor and bicolor patterns. In temperament, Basset Hounds are mild, never sharp or timid, and are known for their extreme devotion. They are capable of great endurance in the field, moving deliberately but not clumsily. Originally bred for hunting, they have transitioned into beloved family companions due to their gentle nature and sociable disposition. Notable characteristics include their heavy bone structure relative to size, their soulful expression, and their ability to follow a trail over and through difficult terrain.</p>",
