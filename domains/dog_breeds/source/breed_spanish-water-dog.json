  "full_description": "<p>The Spanish Water Dog (SWD) is a versatile and rustic breed originating from the Iberian Peninsula, particularly Spain. Historically, these dogs were bred for a multitude of tasks, including herding livestock such as sheep and goats, assisting fishermen by retrieving nets and lost tackle, and hunting game in marshlands. Their adaptability made them invaluable companions in various working environments. Physically, the SWD is a medium-sized, well-proportioned dog with a sturdy and athletic build. Males typically stand between 17.5 to 19.75 inches (44.5 to 50 cm) at the withers, while females range from 15.75 to 18 inches (40 to 45.7 cm). Their weight is proportionate to their height, generally falling between 30 to 50 pounds (13.6 to 22.7 kg). One of the breed's most distinctive features is its curly, woolly coat, which can form cords when left untrimmed. This single-layer coat comes in solid colors such as black, brown, beige, or white, as well as bicolor combinations where one color is white. The coat is adapted to the varying humidity and drought conditions of their homeland and should always be maintained in its natural state without aesthetic grooming. Temperamentally, Spanish Water Dogs are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and affectionate nature. They are vigilant and naturally protective, making them excellent watchdogs. Their high energy levels and eagerness to please contribute to their trainability, though they require consistent and structured training routines. Socialization from an early age is crucial to ensure they are well-adjusted and comfortable in various settings. Originally, the SWD's primary roles included herding livestock, assisting fishermen, and hunting. Their keen sense of smell and strong work ethic made them adept at these tasks. In contemporary times, while they still participate in herding and hunting activities, they have also become popular as companion animals and excel in various dog sports and performance events due to their agility and intelligence. Notable characteristics of the breed include their hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally, making them suitable for individuals with allergies. Their versatility in various roles, combined with their affectionate and loyal nature, has contributed to their growing popularity worldwide. However, potential owners should be prepared to meet their exercise and mental stimulation needs to ensure a happy and well-balanced dog.</p>",
