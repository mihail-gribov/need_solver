  "name": "Cavapoo",
  "full_description": "<p>The Cavapoo, also known as the Cavoodle, is a hybrid breed resulting from the cross between a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a Poodle, typically the Miniature or Toy variety. This designer breed emerged in Australia during the late 20th century, aiming to combine the gentle and affectionate nature of the Cavalier with the intelligence and hypoallergenic coat of the Poodle. Cavapoos have since gained popularity worldwide as companion animals due to their adaptable and friendly disposition.</p>\n<p>Physically, Cavapoos are small to medium-sized dogs, with adults typically weighing between 8 to 25 pounds (4 to 11 kg) and standing 9 to 14 inches (23 to 36 cm) tall at the shoulder. Their coats can vary from wavy to curly, often inheriting the low-shedding quality of the Poodle parent, making them a suitable choice for individuals with mild allergies. Common coat colors include cream, apricot, red, black, and tricolor combinations.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Cavapoos are known for their affectionate, friendly, and playful nature. They form strong bonds with their families and thrive on human companionship. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, responding well to positive reinforcement techniques. Early socialization is crucial to ensure they develop into well-rounded adults comfortable with children, other pets, and strangers.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as companion animals, Cavapoos do not have a history of working roles. Their primary purpose has always been to serve as loving and loyal family pets. In modern times, they continue to excel in this role, often participating in therapy work due to their gentle demeanor and empathetic nature.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Cavapoo include their adaptability to various living environments, from apartments to houses with yards, as long as they receive adequate exercise and mental stimulation. Their moderate energy levels require daily physical activity, such as walks or play sessions, to maintain their health and happiness. Additionally, their low-shedding coats require regular grooming to prevent matting and maintain skin health.</p>",
