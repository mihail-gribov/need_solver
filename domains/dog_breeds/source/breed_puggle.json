  "full_description": "<p>The Puggle is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the cross between a Pug and a Beagle. This designer breed emerged in the United States during the 1980s, aiming to combine the Pug's affectionate nature with the Beagle's energetic disposition. Puggles typically exhibit a sturdy, compact body with a slightly elongated muzzle, which may help alleviate some of the breathing issues common in Pugs. Their coat is short and smooth, often displaying a variety of colors, including fawn, black, and tan. The ears are usually floppy, resembling those of the Beagle, and their expressive eyes convey a friendly demeanor. In terms of temperament, Puggles are known for their sociable and affectionate nature. They thrive on human companionship and are generally good with children and other pets. Their playful and energetic behavior makes them suitable for active families. However, they can inherit the Beagle's tendency to bark and the Pug's stubbornness, which may require patient training. Originally bred as companion animals, Puggles do not have a history of working roles. Today, they serve primarily as family pets, appreciated for their loving nature and adaptability to various living environments. Notable characteristics of the Puggle include their friendly disposition, moderate exercise needs, and a tendency to shed, which potential owners should consider.</p>",
