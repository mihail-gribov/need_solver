  "name": "Greyhound",
  "full_description": "<p>The Greyhound is one of the oldest and most revered dog breeds, with a lineage tracing back to ancient Egypt, where depictions of similar dogs adorn tomb walls. These sighthounds were prized for their speed and hunting prowess, qualities that led to their spread across Europe. In medieval Britain, Greyhounds were so esteemed that laws restricted their ownership to royalty and nobility. Physically, Greyhounds are characterized by their sleek, aerodynamic build. They possess a long, narrow head with a flat skull and slight stop, complemented by small, rose-shaped ears. Their eyes are bright and intelligent, set obliquely, and preferably dark. The neck is long and muscular, leading to well-laid shoulders and a deep, capacious chest. Their back is broad and slightly arched over the loin, with powerful hindquarters and a long, tapering tail. The coat is fine and close, coming in colors such as black, white, red, blue, fawn, brindle, or combinations thereof. Temperamentally, Greyhounds are intelligent, gentle, and affectionate. They exhibit a calm demeanor indoors, often content to lounge, yet they possess remarkable stamina and endurance. Originally bred for hunting by sight, Greyhounds excelled in chasing game over open terrain. Today, while some still participate in lure coursing and racing, many serve as beloved companions, appreciated for their gentle nature and minimal grooming needs. Notable characteristics include their exceptional speed, reaching up to 40 miles per hour, and their independent yet affectionate disposition.</p>",
