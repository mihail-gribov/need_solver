  "full_description": "<p>The American Bulldog is a robust and muscular breed with deep roots in American history. Originating from the Old English Bulldog, these dogs were brought to the United States by early settlers and primarily used for farm work, including guarding property and hunting game. Over time, they evolved into versatile working dogs, adept at various tasks on farms and ranches. Physically, American Bulldogs are large and athletic, typically standing between 20 to 28 inches tall and weighing between 60 to 120 pounds. They possess a strong, stocky build with a broad chest and powerful limbs. Their short, smooth coat is predominantly white, often with patches of red, brindle, or fawn. The breed's head is large and square-shaped, featuring a pronounced jaw and a black nose. Their eyes are usually brown, conveying an alert and confident expression. Temperamentally, American Bulldogs are known for their loyalty, courage, and protective nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are often affectionate and gentle with children. However, their protective instincts make them wary of strangers, necessitating proper socialization from an early age. Historically bred for tasks such as catching livestock and guarding property, they exhibit high energy levels and require regular physical and mental stimulation. In modern times, American Bulldogs have transitioned into roles as family companions, guard dogs, and participants in canine sports. Their versatility and adaptability have contributed to their steady popularity among dog enthusiasts. Notable characteristics of the breed include their unwavering loyalty, intelligence, and strong work ethic. They are also recognized for their distinctive appearance, combining strength and agility, which reflects their working heritage.</p>",
