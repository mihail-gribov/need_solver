  "full_description": "<p>The Leonberger is a majestic giant breed originating from Leonberg, Germany, in the mid-19th century. Developed by Heinrich Essig, the breed was created by crossing a female Landseer Newfoundland with a male from the Great St. Bernard Hospice and Monastery, later incorporating the Pyrenean Mountain Dog. This deliberate breeding aimed to produce a dog resembling the lion on the town's crest. The Leonberger quickly gained favor among European royalty, including Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Napoleon III. Physically, Leonbergers are large, muscular dogs with a balanced build. Males typically stand between 28 to 31.5 inches at the shoulder, while females range from 25.5 to 29.5 inches. Their weight is proportionate to their size, with males weighing between 110 to 170 pounds and females between 90 to 140 pounds. They possess a medium to long, water-resistant double coat that comes in colors from golden yellow to red, always accompanied by a black mask. Males often exhibit a lion-like mane around the neck and chest. Temperamentally, Leonbergers are known for their calm, friendly, and gentle nature. They are affectionate with family members, including children, and are generally sociable with other animals. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable. Originally bred for companionship, they have also been utilized in roles such as water rescue and draft work. In modern times, Leonbergers serve as versatile working dogs and devoted family companions. Notable characteristics include their imposing yet graceful presence, webbed paws aiding in swimming, and a distinctive black mask that enhances their expressive faces.</p>",
