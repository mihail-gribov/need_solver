  "full_description": "<p>The Chinese Shar-Pei is an ancient breed originating from Southern China, with historical records dating back to the Han Dynasty around 200 B.C. Initially bred for guarding, hunting, and later dog fighting, the breed's distinctive loose skin and bristly coat were advantageous in combat, preventing opponents from gaining a firm grip. The name 'Shar-Pei' translates to 'sand skin,' reflecting its unique coat texture. The breed faced near extinction during the 20th century but was revived through dedicated efforts in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United States. Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992, the Shar-Pei has since gained global popularity. Physically, the Shar-Pei is a medium-sized, compact dog with a square profile. Males typically stand between 18 to 20 inches at the withers and weigh 45 to 60 pounds, with females being slightly smaller. The breed's most notable features include a broad 'hippopotamus' muzzle, small high-set ears, and a high-set tail that curls over the back. Puppies exhibit abundant wrinkles covering their bodies, which become more concentrated around the head, neck, and shoulders as they mature. The coat is short, harsh, and bristly, coming in various solid colors. Temperamentally, the Shar-Pei is calm, independent, and devoted to its family. While affectionate with familiar people, they can be reserved or wary around strangers. Their strong-willed nature requires consistent, positive reinforcement training from an early age. Historically, the Shar-Pei served as a versatile working dog, excelling in guarding properties, hunting wild boar, and participating in dog fighting. Today, they are primarily companion animals, valued for their loyalty and distinctive appearance. Notable characteristics include their unique wrinkled skin, blue-black tongue, and the 'hippopotamus' muzzle, all contributing to their unmistakable identity.</p>",
