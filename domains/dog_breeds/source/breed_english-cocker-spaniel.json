  "full_description": "<p>The English Cocker Spaniel, often described as 'merry' and 'affectionate,' is a breed with a rich history and versatile capabilities. Originating in England, these dogs were developed to hunt woodcock, a game bird, which is reflected in their name. By the 19th century, they were recognized for their exceptional hunting skills, particularly in flushing and retrieving game. Physically, English Cocker Spaniels are compact and well-balanced, standing approximately 15 to 16 inches tall and weighing between 28 to 32 pounds. They possess a silky, flat or slightly wavy coat that comes in various colors, including solid shades like black, red, and golden, as well as parti-colors and roans. Their expressive, dark eyes and long, lobular ears contribute to their distinctive appearance. Temperamentally, they are gentle, affectionate, and full of life, making them excellent companions. Historically bred for hunting, they exhibit strong working abilities, excelling in flushing and retrieving game. In modern times, their friendly nature and adaptability have made them popular family pets worldwide. Notable characteristics include their ever-wagging tail, indicative of their cheerful disposition, and their versatility in both fieldwork and companionship roles.</p>",
