  "full_description": "<p>The Pomeranian, often affectionately called the 'Pom,' is a toy breed with a rich history and distinctive characteristics. Originating from the Pomerania region, now part of modern-day Germany and Poland, these dogs were initially larger and used for herding and sledding. Over time, selective breeding reduced their size, transforming them into the compact companions we know today. Queen Victoria's fondness for the breed in the 19th century significantly boosted their popularity, leading to the development of the smaller Pomeranians that became fashionable pets. Physically, Pomeranians are small, standing between 6 to 7 inches tall and weighing no more than 7 pounds. They possess a lush double coat that comes in nearly two dozen colors, including orange, black, and cream. Their fox-like faces, characterized by bright, intelligent eyes and small, erect ears, contribute to their alert and vivacious expression. The breed's heavily plumed tail arches over their back, adding to their distinctive silhouette. Temperamentally, Pomeranians are extroverted, lively, and intelligent. They exhibit a buoyant and inquisitive nature, making them engaging companions. Despite their small size, they are known for their boldness and can sometimes be unaware of their diminutive stature, often displaying a commanding presence. Historically, Pomeranians were larger and served as working dogs, assisting in herding and pulling sleds. Their reduction in size over the years shifted their role to that of companion animals. In modern times, they are cherished as affectionate pets and have also excelled in various canine sports, including agility and obedience. Notably, an 11-year-old Pomeranian named Bella became the first toy breed to earn the AKC Scent Work Master title in 2019, showcasing the breed's versatility and intelligence. Pomeranians are renowned for their profuse double coat, which requires regular grooming to maintain its health and appearance. Their expressive faces and spirited demeanor make them stand out among toy breeds. Additionally, their adaptability allows them to thrive in various living environments, from apartments to larger homes, as long as they receive adequate attention and care.</p>",
