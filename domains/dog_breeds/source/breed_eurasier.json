  "full_description": "<p>The Eurasier is a medium-sized spitz-type dog breed that originated in Germany during the 1960s. Developed by Julius Wipfel, the breed was created by crossing the Chow Chow and Wolfspitz (Keeshond) to combine their desirable traits. Later, the Samoyed was introduced to enhance the breed's characteristics, resulting in the Eurasier we know today. Recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 1973, the Eurasier was bred primarily as a companion dog, emphasizing a strong bond with its family.</p>\n<p>Physically, Eurasiers are well-balanced and medium-sized, with males standing between 52 to 60 cm (20.5 to 23.5 inches) at the withers and weighing 23 to 32 kg (50.7 to 70.5 lbs), while females are slightly smaller, measuring 48 to 56 cm (19 to 22 inches) in height and weighing 18 to 26 kg (39.7 to 57.3 lbs). They possess a thick double coat that comes in various colors, including fawn, red, wolf-gray, solid black, and black and tan. Notably, pure white, white patches, or liver-colored coats are not permitted. Their ears are pricked, and they often have a pink, blue-black, or spotted tongue.</p>\n<p>Eurasiers are known for their calm and even-tempered nature. They are watchful and alert without being overly noisy, displaying a dignified reserve towards strangers while forming strong, affectionate bonds with their families. This breed is intelligent and trainable, responding well to positive reinforcement methods. They are sensitive to harsh discipline and thrive in environments where they are treated with understanding and consistency.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as companion dogs, Eurasiers do not have a strong hunting instinct and are not suited for roles such as guard or sled dogs. They excel in their role as family companions and can perform well as therapy dogs due to their empathetic nature. Their moderate energy levels make them suitable for various activities, including daily walks and playtime.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Eurasier remains a cherished companion, particularly in Europe, where the breed is most prevalent. Their unique combination of physical beauty, balanced temperament, and strong family bonds has contributed to their growing popularity among dog enthusiasts.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Eurasier include their thick double coat, which requires regular grooming, their reserved yet affectionate demeanor, and their adaptability to family life. Their sensitivity to their environment and strong attachment to their owners make them exceptional companions for those who can provide the attention and care they require.</p>",
