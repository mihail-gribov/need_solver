  "full_description": "<p>The Australian Cattle Dog, also known as the Blue Heeler or Queensland Heeler, is a robust and intelligent breed developed in 19th-century Australia to manage cattle over vast and rugged terrains. Originating from crosses between British herding dogs and the native Dingo, these dogs were bred for endurance, agility, and a strong work ethic. Physically, they are medium-sized with a compact, muscular build, featuring a short double coat that comes in blue or red speckled patterns. Their alert expression is highlighted by pricked ears and dark, oval-shaped eyes. Temperamentally, Australian Cattle Dogs are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and high energy levels. They form strong bonds with their owners and can be protective, making them excellent watchdogs. Their herding instinct is strong, and they may attempt to herd children or other animals by nipping at heels. Originally bred for herding cattle, they possess remarkable stamina and determination, traits that have transitioned well into modern roles such as agility sports, obedience competitions, and as active companions. Notable characteristics include their problem-solving abilities, independence, and a need for regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors.</p>",
