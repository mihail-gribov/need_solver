  "full_description": "<p>The Boxer is a medium to large-sized breed that originated in Germany during the late 19th century. Developed from the now-extinct Bullenbeisser and the English Bulldog, Boxers were initially bred for hunting large game such as boar and bison. Their strong, muscular build and tenacious nature made them adept at holding prey until hunters arrived. Over time, their roles expanded to include guarding, military work, and companionship. Physically, Boxers are characterized by a square, well-proportioned body with a deep chest and strong limbs. They possess a distinctive head with a broad, blunt muzzle and a slightly upturned nose. Their expressive, dark eyes and naturally floppy ears contribute to their alert and intelligent expression. The breed's short, smooth coat comes in fawn or brindle, often with white markings. Boxers are renowned for their playful, energetic, and affectionate temperament. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their protective instincts, making them excellent watchdogs. Their intelligence and eagerness to please facilitate training, though they can exhibit a stubborn streak. Historically, Boxers were utilized for various working roles, including hunting, guarding, and military service. Their strength, agility, and loyalty made them valuable assets in these capacities. In contemporary times, Boxers are popular family companions and excel in dog sports such as agility, obedience, and rally. Their friendly disposition and versatility contribute to their enduring popularity worldwide. Notable characteristics of the Boxer include their boundless energy, playful nature, and distinctive 'boxing' behavior, where they use their front paws in a manner reminiscent of a boxer's sparring. Their short coat requires minimal grooming, and they are known for their expressive faces and strong, athletic build.</p>",
