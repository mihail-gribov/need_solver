  "full_description": "<p>The Rottweiler is a medium-large, robust, and powerful dog breed with a rich history dating back to ancient Rome. Originally developed from mastiff-type dogs used for herding and guarding livestock, Rottweilers accompanied Roman legions across the Alps, protecting and driving cattle. As the Romans established settlements, these dogs became integral to the town of Rottweil in Germany, where they were known as \"butcher dogs\" for their role in herding cattle to market and pulling carts laden with butchered meat. This historical background underscores the breed's strength, endurance, and versatility.</p>\n<p>Physically, Rottweilers are distinguished by their black coats with clearly defined rust to mahogany markings. Males typically stand between 24 to 27 inches at the shoulder, while females range from 22 to 25 inches. Their compact and substantial build conveys great strength, agility, and endurance. The breed's head is of medium length with a broad skull, and their ears are small and pendant-shaped. Their coat is of medium length, coarse, and flat, with a dense undercoat that is essential on the neck and thighs.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Rottweilers are known for their calm, confident, and courageous nature. They possess a strong protective instinct, making them excellent guard dogs. While they can be reserved with strangers, they are affectionate and loyal to their families. Their intelligence and adaptability make them suitable for various roles, including police work, therapy, and participation in dog sports such as Schutzhund training, agility, carting, herding, and obedience.</p>\n<p>Historically, Rottweilers were bred for herding and guarding livestock, as well as pulling carts for butchers. In the early 20th century, their versatility led to their use as police dogs, and they have since become popular as loyal household companions.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Rottweilers continue to serve as working dogs in various capacities, including search and rescue, police work, and as therapy dogs. Their popularity has remained strong, and they are recognized for their affectionate yet watchful nature.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Rottweiler include their strong protective instincts, intelligence, and versatility. They are known to be \"leaners,\" often leaning against their owners, a behavior thought to originate from their herding background.</p>",
