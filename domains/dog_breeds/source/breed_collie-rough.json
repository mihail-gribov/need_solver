  "full_description": "<p>The Rough Collie, also known as the Long-Haired Collie, is a distinguished herding breed originating from Scotland and Wales. Historically, the Scottish variety was a robust and aggressive dog adept at managing highland sheep, while the Welsh counterpart was smaller, nimble, and friendly, often herding goats. The interbreeding of these regional dogs with English sheepdogs led to the development of both short and long-haired varieties. The introduction of the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) into the gene pool in the 19th century refined the breed's head shape, resulting in the elongated muzzle characteristic of today's Rough Collie. Queen Victoria's acquisition of a Rough Collie during her stay at Balmoral Castle significantly boosted the breed's popularity, transforming it into a fashionable companion. Physically, the Rough Collie is a medium to large-sized dog, with males standing between 55.8 to 66 cm (22 to 26 inches) at the shoulder and females slightly shorter. They possess a long, dense double coat that forms a notable ruff around the neck, with recognized colors including sable and white, tricolor, blue merle, and color-headed white. The breed's head is light in relation to the body, resembling a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with medium-sized almond-shaped eyes and semi-prick ears. Temperamentally, Rough Collies are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and gentle nature. They are excellent with children and other animals, making them ideal family companions. However, they require proper socialization to prevent shyness and can be fairly vocal, though they are easily trained to manage barking tendencies. Historically bred for herding, Rough Collies are capable of covering significant distances and exhibit a strong herding instinct. While their primary role has shifted to companionship, they still participate in herding activities and excel in various dog sports. The breed's popularity was further cemented by the fictional character Lassie, a Rough Collie who became a cultural icon through books, films, and television series. Notable characteristics of the Rough Collie include their striking appearance, intelligence, and versatility, making them both a capable working dog and a beloved family member.</p>",
