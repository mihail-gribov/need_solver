  "full_description": "<p>The Labradoodle is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle, either Standard or Miniature. The term 'Labradoodle' was first used in 1955 but gained prominence in 1988 when Australian breeder Wally Conron introduced the crossbreed to the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia. Conron aimed to combine the low-shedding coat of the Poodle with the gentle temperament and trainability of the Labrador Retriever to create a guide dog suitable for individuals with allergies. The first successful Labradoodle, named Sultan, exhibited the desired traits and served as a guide dog for a woman in Hawaii for ten years. Physically, Labradoodles display a range of appearances due to their hybrid nature. Their coats can be curly, wavy, or straight, with textures varying from wiry to soft. Common coat colors include chocolate, café, parchment, cream, gold, apricot, red, black, silver, chalk, lavender, and blueish gray. Labradoodles come in three size categories: Miniature (14–16 inches tall, 15–25 pounds), Medium (17–20 inches tall, 30–45 pounds), and Standard (21–24 inches tall, 50–65 pounds). Temperamentally, Labradoodles are known for their friendly and energetic nature. They are generally good with families and children, often displaying an affinity for water and strong swimming abilities inherited from their parent breeds. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, though early socialization and consistent training are essential to manage their exuberance. Originally bred as guide dogs, Labradoodles have expanded their roles to include therapy and assistance work due to their adaptable and gentle disposition. They have also become popular family pets worldwide. Notable characteristics of Labradoodles include their potential hypoallergenic coats, which can be beneficial for allergy sufferers, and their versatility in various working roles. However, it's important to note that, as a hybrid breed, Labradoodles can inherit a range of traits from their parent breeds, leading to variability in appearance and temperament.</p>",
