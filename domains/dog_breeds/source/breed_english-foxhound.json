  "full_description": "<p>The English Foxhound is a distinguished breed with a rich heritage dating back to the 13th century in Great Britain. Developed specifically for the purpose of trailing the red fox during mounted hunts, this breed was meticulously crafted by crossing St. Hubert/Bloodhound types with swifter hounds, possibly including the Greyhound, to achieve a balance of endurance and speed.</p>\n<p>Physically, the English Foxhound presents a well-balanced, powerful, and clean-cut appearance. Males typically stand between 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder, with females slightly smaller. They possess a flat skull, long square muzzle, and moderately developed flews. Their ears are set high, pendant, and lie close to the head. The breed's coat is short, dense, and weatherproof, commonly found in any hound color, including combinations of black, tan, and white.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, English Foxhounds are friendly, sociable, and outgoing. Bred to work in packs, they exhibit a natural affinity for companionship, both with other dogs and humans. Their energetic and enthusiastic nature makes them excellent companions for active families.</p>\n<p>Originally, the English Foxhound was bred for foxhunting, a sport where horse-mounted riders chased wild quarry with a pack of hounds. The hounds would track the fox, and the riders would follow, listening for the hounds' vocalizations upon locating the prey. In modern times, while traditional foxhunting has declined, the breed's exceptional scenting abilities and stamina have found roles in various canine sports and activities, including agility and field trials. Despite their historical significance, English Foxhounds remain one of the rarer breeds in the United States, with fewer than 50 new registrations each year with the American Kennel Club.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the English Foxhound include their remarkable stamina, keen sense of smell, and determination. These traits, combined with their friendly and sociable demeanor, make them both excellent working dogs and companions for those who can meet their exercise and socialization needs.</p>",
