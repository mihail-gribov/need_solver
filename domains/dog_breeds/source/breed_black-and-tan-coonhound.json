  "full_description": "<p>The Black and Tan Coonhound is a distinguished American breed renowned for its exceptional scent-trailing abilities and versatility in hunting. Originating in the United States, this breed was developed by crossing the Bloodhound with the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound, aiming to create a dog adept at tracking and treeing raccoons. This lineage endowed the Black and Tan Coonhound with a keen sense of smell and a robust constitution, enabling it to perform efficiently across diverse terrains and weather conditions. Physically, the Black and Tan Coonhound presents a powerful and agile build. Males typically stand between 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder, while females range from 23 to 25 inches. Their weight varies from 50 to 75 pounds, with males generally being heavier. The breed's coat is short, dense, and glossy, predominantly coal black with rich tan markings above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, chest, legs, and beneath the tail. Notable features include long, wide, and thin ears set low and far back on the head, and dark brown to black eyes that convey a pleading expression. The tail is set slightly below the backline and carried at a right angle when the dog is alert. Temperamentally, Black and Tan Coonhounds are known for their mellow and amiable nature indoors, making them suitable companions. They exhibit a strong hunting instinct outdoors, often becoming single-minded when on a scent trail. This breed is gentle and tolerant with children but may display independence, which can be challenging for playful youngsters. They tend to be reserved around strangers, often baying or howling in their presence. As scent hounds, they possess a loud, deep, and baying bark, which is distinctive and can be heard over long distances. Originally bred for trailing and treeing raccoons, the Black and Tan Coonhound's courage and determination also make it proficient in hunting larger game such as deer, bear, and mountain lions. Its exceptional olfactory senses allow it to track scents over vast distances, making it a valuable asset to hunters. In contemporary settings, while still utilized in hunting, the breed has also found a place as a loyal family companion. Its adaptability and friendly disposition have contributed to its steady popularity among dog enthusiasts. Notable characteristics of the Black and Tan Coonhound include its remarkable scent-trailing ability, endurance, and distinctive vocalizations. The breed's combination of strength, agility, and keen senses makes it a unique and cherished member of the hound group.</p>",
