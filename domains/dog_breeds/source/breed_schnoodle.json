  "full_description": "<p>The Schnoodle is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the cross between a Schnauzer and a Poodle. This designer breed was developed in the United States during the 1980s with the aim of combining the Poodle's hypoallergenic coat and intelligence with the Schnauzer's loyalty and alertness. Schnoodles come in various sizes, depending on the size of their parent breeds, ranging from Toy to Giant. Their coats are typically low-shedding and can be wavy or curly, available in colors such as black, gray, silver, brown, apricot, and white. They possess expressive faces with bright, alert eyes and often inherit the Schnauzer's distinctive beard. Schnoodles are known for their affectionate and intelligent nature, forming strong bonds with their families. They are energetic and require regular physical and mental stimulation to prevent boredom. Originally bred as companion animals, Schnoodles have also been utilized in therapy work due to their friendly disposition. Their popularity has grown over the years, especially among families seeking a low-shedding, intelligent, and loyal pet. Notable characteristics of the Schnoodle include their adaptability to various living environments, suitability for families with children, and their potential as watchdogs due to their alertness.</p>",
