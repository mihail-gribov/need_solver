  "full_description": "<p>The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a British toy breed with a rich history dating back to the 17th century. Originally bred as companion dogs for royalty, particularly King Charles II, these spaniels were cherished for their affectionate nature and elegant appearance. Over time, the breed evolved, and in the 1920s, efforts were made to recreate the original type depicted in historical paintings, leading to the modern Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</p>\n<p>Physically, Cavaliers are small, well-balanced dogs standing 12 to 13 inches tall at the withers and weighing between 13 and 18 pounds. They possess a moderately long, silky coat that comes in four recognized color patterns: Blenheim (chestnut and white), Tricolor (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. Their large, dark eyes and gentle expression contribute to their endearing appearance.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Cavaliers are known for their affectionate, playful, and patient nature. They are highly social and thrive on human companionship, making them excellent family pets. Their adaptability allows them to fit well into various living situations, from apartments to larger homes. While they have a sporting heritage, their primary role has always been that of a companion, and they excel in providing comfort and companionship.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel has gained popularity worldwide, ranking as the 13th most popular purebred in the United States as of 2022. Their gentle disposition and adaptability make them suitable for families, singles, and seniors alike. Notable characteristics include their eagerness to please, making them relatively easy to train, and their tendency to form strong bonds with their owners, often following them from room to room.</p>\n<p>Despite their many positive traits, potential owners should be aware of certain health concerns prevalent in the breed, such as mitral valve disease and syringomyelia. Regular veterinary check-ups and responsible breeding practices are essential to ensure the health and longevity of these beloved companions.</p>",
