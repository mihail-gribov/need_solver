  "full_description": "<p>The Bulldog, also known as the English Bulldog, is a medium-sized breed renowned for its distinctive appearance and gentle disposition. Originating in England, Bulldogs were initially bred for bull-baiting, a cruel sport that was eventually outlawed in the 19th century. Following the ban, breeders focused on developing a more docile and affectionate companion, leading to the modern Bulldog's amiable nature. Physically, Bulldogs possess a muscular, low-slung body with a broad chest and sturdy limbs. Their large, square heads feature a short muzzle, characteristic wrinkles, and a pronounced underbite. The breed's coat is short, smooth, and comes in various colors, including brindle, white, fawn, and piebald. Bulldogs are known for their calm and friendly temperament. They form strong bonds with their families and are particularly gentle with children, making them excellent family pets. Despite their somewhat stubborn nature, they respond well to patient and consistent training. Historically, Bulldogs were used in bull-baiting due to their strength and tenacity. Today, they serve primarily as companion animals, cherished for their loyalty and affectionate demeanor. Their popularity remains high, consistently ranking among the top breeds in various countries. Notable characteristics of Bulldogs include their distinctive facial wrinkles, which require regular cleaning to prevent infections, and their brachycephalic (short-nosed) structure, which can lead to breathing difficulties. Their low energy levels make them suitable for apartment living, but they still require regular, moderate exercise to maintain a healthy weight.</p>",
