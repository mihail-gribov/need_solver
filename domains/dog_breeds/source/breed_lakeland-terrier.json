  "name": "Lakeland Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Lakeland Terrier, originating from England's Lake District, was developed in the 19th century to hunt vermin and protect livestock from foxes. Bred for agility and endurance, they are small, sturdy dogs with a square build, standing about 14.5 inches tall and weighing between 15 to 17 pounds. Their dense, wiry double coat comes in various colors, including black, blue, liver, red, and wheaten, often with saddle markings. Lakelands are known for their bold, friendly, and self-confident temperament. They are intelligent and quick learners but can be independent, requiring consistent training. Originally bred for hunting, they possess a strong prey drive and excel in activities like Earthdog trials. Today, they serve as affectionate family companions and participate in dog sports. Notable characteristics include their minimal shedding, making them suitable for allergy sufferers, and their energetic nature, which necessitates regular exercise.</p>",
