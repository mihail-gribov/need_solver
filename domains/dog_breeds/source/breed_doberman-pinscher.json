  "full_description": "<p>The Doberman Pinscher, often referred to simply as the Doberman, is a medium-large breed of domestic dog originally developed in Germany in the late 19th century. The breed's creator, Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, was a tax collector who sought to develop a loyal and protective companion to accompany him during his duties. By selectively breeding dogs such as the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and the German Pinscher, he achieved a versatile working dog known for its intelligence, strength, and loyalty.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Doberman presents a sleek and athletic build. Males typically stand between 68 to 72 cm (27 to 28 inches) at the withers and weigh around 40 to 45 kg (88 to 99 pounds), while females are slightly smaller, measuring 63 to 68 cm (25 to 27 inches) in height and weighing 32 to 35 kg (70 to 77 pounds). Their coat is short, hard, and close-lying, commonly found in black and tan or red and tan colorations.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Dobermans are known for their intelligence, alertness, and unwavering loyalty. They are energetic and require consistent physical and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and the development of undesirable behaviors. Their protective nature makes them excellent guard dogs, yet they are also affectionate with their families. Early socialization and training are crucial to ensure they are well-mannered and adaptable.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for protection and companionship, Dobermans have excelled in various working roles, including police and military service, search and rescue, and as therapy dogs. Their versatility and trainability have made them a popular choice for these demanding tasks.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Doberman remains a popular breed worldwide. According to statistics compiled by the American Kennel Club in 2009, the Doberman Pinscher ranked 15th in registrations, reflecting its enduring appeal.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their sleek appearance, high intelligence, and strong protective instincts. They are also known for their loyalty and affectionate nature towards their families, making them both formidable protectors and loving companions.</p>",
