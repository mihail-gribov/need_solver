  "name": "Belgian Malinois",
  "full_description": "<p>The Belgian Malinois, one of the four Belgian Shepherd breeds, originated in the late 19th century in the city of Malines (Mechelen) in Belgium. Developed primarily for herding and guarding livestock, the Malinois was bred for its intelligence, agility, and strong work ethic.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Belgian Malinois is a medium-to-large dog with a well-balanced, square build. Males typically stand between 24 to 26 inches tall, while females range from 22 to 24 inches. Their weight varies from 40 to 80 pounds, with males generally heavier than females. The breed's coat is short, dense, and weather-resistant, predominantly fawn to mahogany in color, often with black-tipped hairs and a characteristic black mask and ears.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Malinois are known for their high energy levels, intelligence, and strong desire to work. They are confident and alert, often reserved with strangers but affectionate with their families. Their protective nature makes them excellent watchdogs, and they thrive on having a job to do, whether it's herding, obedience, or protection work.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for herding, the Malinois has demonstrated exceptional versatility. Their keen intelligence and trainability have made them favorites in police and military roles worldwide. Notably, their lighter weight compared to breeds like the German Shepherd allows them to perform tasks such as skydiving more efficiently.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Belgian Malinois has gained popularity not only as a working dog but also as a companion animal. Their athleticism and eagerness to please make them suitable for various dog sports, including agility, obedience, and dock diving. However, their high energy and need for mental stimulation mean they are best suited for active owners who can provide regular exercise and training.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their unwavering loyalty, exceptional work ethic, and adaptability. Their keen senses and quick reflexes make them stand out in roles requiring precision and reliability. While they can be reserved with strangers, their bond with their families is profound, often forming deep connections with their owners.</p>",
