  "name": "Swedish Vallhund",
  "full_description": "<p>The Swedish Vallhund, also known as the Västgötaspets, is an ancient breed with roots tracing back over a millennium to the Viking era in Sweden. Originally developed as an all-purpose farm dog, the Vallhund was primarily utilized for herding cattle, guarding property, and controlling vermin. The breed faced near extinction in the early 1940s but was revived through dedicated efforts, leading to its recognition by the Swedish Kennel Club in 1943. Physically, the Swedish Vallhund is a small, robust, and sturdy dog with a slightly longer body than its height, giving it a rectangular appearance. Males typically stand about 12.5 to 13.5 inches at the withers, while females are slightly shorter at 11.5 to 12.5 inches. They possess a wedge-shaped head, dark brown oval eyes, and pricked ears. Their tails vary naturally in length, ranging from no tail (bobtail) to full length, and all variations are acceptable. The breed's double coat consists of a harsh, close-lying topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat. Coat colors range from grey, greyish brown, and greyish yellow to reddish brown, often with characteristic 'harness markings' on the shoulders. Temperamentally, Swedish Vallhunds are known for their intelligence, alertness, and energy. They are friendly, playful, and confident, making them excellent companions. Their herding background contributes to a strong work ethic and a desire to be active. Historically, they were adept at herding cattle and served as vigilant watchdogs. In modern times, while they still excel in herding, they have also become popular in various dog sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking. Their versatility and engaging personality have contributed to a steady increase in popularity worldwide. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive 'wolf-like' facial markings, vocal nature, and the unique variation in tail length. Their adaptability and eagerness to please make them suitable for various roles, from working dogs to beloved family pets.</p>",
