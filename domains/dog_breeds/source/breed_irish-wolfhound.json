  "full_description": "<p>The Irish Wolfhound, known in Irish as Cú Faoil, is a breed of large sighthound that has inspired literature, poetry, and mythology. Originating in Ireland, these dogs were historically used for hunting wolves and deer, showcasing their strength and speed. By the 18th century, the breed faced near extinction due to the decline of wolves in Ireland. However, in the late 19th century, Captain George Augustus Graham spearheaded efforts to revive the breed by crossbreeding the few remaining Irish Wolfhounds with breeds like the Scottish Deerhound and Great Dane. Physically, the Irish Wolfhound is the tallest of all dog breeds, with males standing at least 32 inches (81 cm) tall and females at least 30 inches (76 cm). They possess a rough, hard coat that can be gray, brindle, red, black, white, fawn, or wheaten. Their build combines the speed of a sighthound with the strength to tackle large game. Temperamentally, Irish Wolfhounds are known for their gentle and friendly nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are generally good with children and other pets. While they are not typically aggressive, their imposing size can serve as a deterrent to intruders. Historically bred for hunting large game, their modern role has shifted to that of a companion animal. Despite their hunting origins, they are not known for being aggressive and are often described as gentle giants. Notable characteristics of the breed include their towering stature, rough coat, and calm demeanor. They require regular exercise to maintain their health but are not overly energetic. Their coat needs regular brushing to prevent matting, and due to their size, they require ample space to move comfortably.</p>",
