  "name": "Shetland Sheepdog",
  "full_description": "<p>The Shetland Sheepdog, affectionately known as the Sheltie, originated in the rugged Shetland Islands of Scotland during the 1800s. Developed by crossing small, intelligent, longhaired breeds with the Border Collie, the Sheltie was bred to herd sheep, ponies, and chickens, effectively keeping them away from cultivated fields in a land with few fences. The harsh terrain and sparse vegetation of the islands favored smaller livestock, necessitating a compact yet agile herding dog. Early Shelties were notably smaller, standing 8 to 10 inches at the withers, but selective breeding increased their size to the current standard of 13 to 16 inches.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Sheltie presents a refined, symmetrical appearance reminiscent of a miniature Rough Collie. They possess a long, blunt wedge-shaped head with a flat skull and a slight but definite stop. Their almond-shaped eyes, set somewhat obliquely, convey an alert and intelligent expression. Ears are small, moderately wide at the base, and carried semi-erect with the top one-fourth tipping forward when alert. The double coat consists of a long, harsh, straight outer coat and a short, dense undercoat, providing protection against harsh weather. Common coat colors include sable, black, and blue merle, often with white markings.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Shelties are affectionate, loyal, and highly intelligent, making them eager to please and responsive to training. They are known for their sensitivity to their family's moods and are often described as 'shadow' dogs, following their owners closely. While they are gentle and playful with children, they can be reserved or shy around strangers, making early socialization crucial. Their herding instincts may manifest as nipping at heels during play, a behavior that should be managed through training.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for herding, Shelties excel in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and herding trials. Their intelligence and eagerness to learn make them suitable for roles as service and therapy dogs. In modern times, they have become popular family companions, ranking consistently among the top breeds in registration statistics. Their compact size, combined with their energetic and affectionate nature, makes them well-suited for both urban and rural living environments.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Shetland Sheepdog include their keen intelligence, agility, and strong herding instincts. They are known for their vocal nature, often barking to alert their owners of strangers or unusual occurrences. Their beautiful, flowing coat requires regular grooming to maintain its condition and prevent matting. Overall, the Sheltie is a versatile and devoted breed, thriving in environments where they can engage both their minds and bodies.</p>",
