  "full_description": "<p>The Chihuahua, named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, is one of the smallest dog breeds globally, renowned for its diminutive size and vibrant personality.</p>\n<p><strong>Origin and History</strong></p>\n<p>The Chihuahua's origins trace back to ancient Mexico, where they are believed to descend from the Techichi, a small companion dog favored by the Toltec civilization. DNA studies suggest that native American dogs, including the Chihuahua, have a genetic lineage dating back approximately 10,000 years, with some pre-colonial ancestry still present in the breed today.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Appearance</strong></p>\n<p>Chihuahuas possess a distinctive \"apple-shaped\" skull with large, round eyes and prominent, erect ears. They come in two coat varieties: smooth (short-haired) and long-haired, both of which can display a wide range of colors and patterns. Despite their small stature, typically weighing between 2 to 6 pounds (0.9 to 2.7 kg) and standing 6 to 9 inches (15 to 23 cm) tall, Chihuahuas have a well-balanced and compact build.</p>\n<p><strong>Temperament and Personality Traits</strong></p>\n<p>Chihuahuas are known for their alertness, energy, and deep loyalty to their owners. They often form strong bonds with one or two individuals, sometimes displaying a preference for a single person. Despite their small size, they exhibit a bold and confident demeanor, often unaware of their diminutive stature. Early socialization is crucial to prevent excessive wariness or aggression towards strangers and other animals.</p>\n<p><strong>Working Abilities and Original Purpose</strong></p>\n<p>Historically, Chihuahuas were primarily companion animals, valued for their affectionate nature and companionship. There is evidence suggesting they were also used in religious ceremonies and possibly as a food source in ancient civilizations. Unlike breeds developed for specific working tasks, Chihuahuas have always been cherished for their companionship.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Role and Popularity</strong></p>\n<p>Today, Chihuahuas are popular companion animals worldwide, especially suited for urban living due to their small size and adaptability. Their portability and minimal exercise requirements make them ideal for apartment dwellers and individuals with limited space. Their distinctive appearance and lively personality have also made them a favorite in popular culture and media.</p>\n<p><strong>Notable Characteristics</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Molera</strong>: A soft spot on the skull, similar to a human infant's fontanelle, which may persist into adulthood.</li>\n<li><strong>Vocal Nature</strong>: Chihuahuas are known for their alertness and tendency to bark at unfamiliar stimuli, making them effective, albeit small, watchdogs.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitivity to Cold</strong>: Due to their small size and thin coat, Chihuahuas are sensitive to cold temperatures and may require additional warmth in cooler climates.</li>\n<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: They have a relatively long lifespan, often living between 12 to 20 years with proper care.</li>\n</ul>",
