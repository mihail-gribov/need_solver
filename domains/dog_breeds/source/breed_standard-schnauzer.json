  "name": "Standard Schnauzer",
  "full_description": "<p>The Standard Schnauzer, originating in 14th-century Germany, was developed as a versatile farm dog adept at guarding property, herding livestock, and controlling vermin populations. The breed's name, derived from the German word 'schnauze' meaning 'snout,' highlights its distinctive bearded muzzle. Historically, these dogs were known as Wire-Haired Pinschers and were first exhibited in Germany in the 1870s. They gained popularity in the United States in the early 20th century, with the American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizing the breed in 1904. Physically, Standard Schnauzers are medium-sized, robust, and squarely built, standing between 17.5 to 19.5 inches tall and weighing 30 to 50 pounds. They possess a dense, wiry double coat in solid black or salt-and-pepper colorations, complemented by arched eyebrows and a bristly beard. Their expressive dark brown eyes and V-shaped ears, which may be cropped or natural, contribute to their alert appearance. Temperamentally, Standard Schnauzers are intelligent, energetic, and affectionate. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their protective nature, making them excellent watchdogs. Their high intelligence and problem-solving abilities require consistent, positive reinforcement training to manage their sometimes stubborn tendencies. Originally bred for farm work, including guarding and ratting, they have transitioned into roles such as therapy, service, and search-and-rescue dogs. Their versatility also shines in dog sports like obedience, agility, and herding trials. In modern times, Standard Schnauzers are cherished companions, valued for their loyalty, playfulness, and adaptability to various living environments. Notable characteristics include their distinctive facial hair, which requires regular grooming, and their spirited, reliable nature that endears them to families worldwide.</p>",
