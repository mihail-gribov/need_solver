  "full_description": "<p>The Airedale Terrier, often referred to as the 'King of Terriers,' is the largest of the terrier breeds, originating from the Aire Valley in Yorkshire, England. Developed in the mid-19th century by crossing the Old English Black and Tan Terrier with the Otterhound, the breed was designed to create a versatile hunting and working dog capable of handling both land and water tasks. This combination resulted in a dog adept at hunting small game, such as rats and otters, while also serving as a reliable farm and guard dog. Physically, Airedales are medium to large-sized dogs, with males typically standing around 23 inches (58 cm) at the shoulder and weighing between 50 to 70 pounds (23 to 32 kg). Females are slightly smaller. They possess a dense, wiry coat that is predominantly tan with a black or grizzle saddle, and their expressive faces are framed by folded ears and a distinctive beard. Their tails are traditionally carried high and were historically docked, though this practice has become less common due to legal restrictions in many countries. Temperamentally, Airedales are known for their intelligence, confidence, and playful nature. They are loyal and protective of their families, making them excellent companions and watchdogs. Their energetic and curious disposition requires regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and potential behavioral issues. Originally bred for hunting and working purposes, Airedales have demonstrated versatility in various roles, including serving as war dogs, police dogs, and search and rescue animals. Their keen sense of smell and determination made them invaluable during World War I for delivering messages and locating wounded soldiers. In contemporary times, Airedales continue to be cherished as family pets, excelling in activities such as obedience, agility, and even therapy work. Their adaptability and engaging personalities have maintained their popularity among dog enthusiasts worldwide. Notable characteristics of the Airedale include their hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally but requires regular grooming to maintain its condition. They are also known for their problem-solving abilities and independent thinking, traits that can be both endearing and challenging for owners. With proper training and socialization, Airedales make affectionate and devoted companions, embodying a unique blend of tenacity and charm.</p>",
