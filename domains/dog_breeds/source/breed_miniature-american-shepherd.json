  "full_description": "<p>The Miniature American Shepherd (MAS) is a small herding breed that originated in the United States during the late 1960s. Developed by breeding smaller Australian Shepherds, the goal was to create a compact, versatile herding dog suitable for equestrian enthusiasts and those seeking a smaller companion with strong working abilities. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2015.</p>\n<p>Physically, the MAS is a well-balanced, athletic dog standing between 14 to 18 inches (36–46 cm) tall for males and 13 to 17 inches (33–43 cm) for females, with weights ranging from 20 to 40 pounds (9–18 kg). They possess a medium-length double coat that can be straight or slightly wavy, providing weather resistance. Coat colors include black, blue merle, red, and red merle, often accompanied by white and/or tan markings.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, MAS are intelligent, energetic, and eager to please, making them highly trainable. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty and affectionate nature. Their herding instincts remain strong, and they may exhibit behaviors such as nipping at heels, especially in the presence of children or other animals.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for herding livestock, including sheep and goats, the MAS retains its working abilities and excels in various dog sports such as agility, obedience, and flyball. Their compact size and agility make them suitable for both rural and urban environments, provided they receive adequate physical and mental stimulation.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the MAS has gained popularity as both a working dog and a companion animal. Their adaptability, intelligence, and manageable size have endeared them to a wide range of dog enthusiasts. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive merle coat patterns, expressive eyes that can be brown, blue, hazel, or amber, and their strong affinity for human companionship.</p>",
