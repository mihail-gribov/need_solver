  "full_description": "<p>The Bullmastiff is a large, powerful breed developed in 19th-century England to assist gamekeepers in protecting estates from poachers. By crossing the English Mastiff with the now-extinct Old English Bulldog, breeders aimed to create a dog that combined the size and strength of the Mastiff with the agility and tenacity of the Bulldog. This deliberate mix resulted in a breed that was 60% Mastiff and 40% Bulldog, known for its ability to track, apprehend, and hold intruders without inflicting serious injury. Recognized by The Kennel Club in 1924 and the American Kennel Club in 1934, the Bullmastiff has since become a valued companion and guardian worldwide.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Bullmastiff presents a nearly square appearance, with males standing 25 to 27 inches tall and weighing between 110 to 130 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 24 to 26 inches in height and 100 to 120 pounds in weight. Their short, dense coat comes in fawn, red, or brindle, often accompanied by a black mask and darker ears. The breed's broad skull, short muzzle, and V-shaped ears contribute to its distinctive, imposing look.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Bullmastiffs are known for their reliability, devotion, and protective nature. They are alert and fearless yet exhibit a calm and docile demeanor, making them excellent family companions. Their original purpose as estate guardians has endowed them with a natural instinct to protect their home and loved ones.</p>\n<p>Historically, Bullmastiffs were bred to guard estates, utilizing their strength and agility to deter poachers. Their role required them to be powerful enough to apprehend intruders but controlled enough not to cause undue harm. In modern times, while they continue to serve as effective guard dogs, Bullmastiffs have also gained popularity as loyal family pets, appreciated for their gentle disposition and unwavering loyalty.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Bullmastiff include their keen intelligence, strong protective instincts, and affectionate nature towards their families. Despite their formidable appearance, they are known to be gentle with children and can coexist peacefully with other pets when properly socialized. Their low grooming needs and moderate exercise requirements make them suitable for various living situations, provided they receive adequate mental and physical stimulation.</p>",
