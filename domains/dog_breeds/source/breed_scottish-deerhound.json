  "full_description": "<p>The Scottish Deerhound, often referred to as the 'Royal Dog of Scotland,' is a breed with a rich heritage dating back to the Middle Ages. Originally bred in the Scottish Highlands, these dogs were developed to hunt red deer by coursing, utilizing their exceptional speed and keen sight. Their noble stature and hunting prowess made them highly valued among Scottish chieftains and nobility. Physically, the Scottish Deerhound resembles a larger, more robust Greyhound, standing between 28 to 32 inches tall and weighing 75 to 110 pounds. They possess a long, narrow head with a tapering muzzle, dark eyes, and small, folded ears. Their coat is harsh and wiry, typically in shades of blue-gray, gray, or brindle, providing protection against the harsh Scottish climate. Temperamentally, Deerhounds are gentle, dignified, and affectionate. They are known for their calm demeanor indoors, often content to lounge, yet they exhibit bursts of energy and enthusiasm during outdoor activities. Their independent nature can sometimes pose challenges in training, requiring patience and consistency. Historically bred for hunting, they possess a strong prey drive and excel in activities that allow them to utilize their speed and agility. In modern times, while their role as hunters has diminished, Scottish Deerhounds have found a place as cherished companions, admired for their grace and gentle nature. They are relatively rare, ranking 154th in popularity among breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. Notable characteristics include their combination of size and speed, a friendly disposition, and a distinctive, weather-resistant coat.</p>",
