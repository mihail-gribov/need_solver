  "full_description": "<p>The Briard, also known as the Berger de Brie, is a French breed of large shepherd dog with a rich history dating back to the 8th century. Originating in the Brie region of France, these dogs were traditionally used for herding and guarding sheep. Their versatility made them invaluable on farms, where they not only managed livestock but also protected the homestead. Notably, historical figures such as Napoleon and Thomas Jefferson were known to have owned Briards. During both World Wars, the Briard served as the official dog of the French army, performing roles such as carrying supplies, acting as sentries, and locating wounded soldiers on the battlefield. Physically, the Briard is a robust and muscular dog, standing between 22 to 27 inches tall and weighing between 55 to 100 pounds. They possess a distinctive long, wavy double coat that comes in colors like black, gray, and tawny. Their expressive eyes are often hidden beneath bushy eyebrows, and they have a characteristic shaggy beard. A unique feature of the breed is the presence of double dewclaws on each rear leg. Temperamentally, Briards are known for their intelligence, loyalty, and protective nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are particularly gentle with children. Their herding instincts make them vigilant and responsive, often displaying a keen sense of awareness of their surroundings. Originally bred for herding and guarding, Briards have a strong work ethic and excel in various canine sports and activities. In modern times, while they are still used in herding, they have also become cherished companion animals. Their affectionate nature and adaptability have contributed to their popularity in households worldwide. Notable characteristics of the Briard include their exceptional memory, agility, and a coat that requires regular grooming to maintain its health and appearance. Their combination of strength, intelligence, and devotion makes them a unique and cherished breed.</p>",
