  "full_description": "<p>The Chinese Crested is a distinctive toy breed known for its two varieties: Hairless and Powderpuff. The Hairless variety features soft, smooth skin with tufts of hair on the head (crest), tail (plume), and feet (socks), while the Powderpuff is covered in a soft, silky double coat. Both types can appear in the same litter due to a genetic trait.</p>\n<p>Originating from Africa or Mexico, the breed was later associated with Chinese sailors who used them to control vermin on ships. These sailors traded the dogs at various ports, spreading the breed globally.</p>\n<p>Physically, Chinese Cresteds are fine-boned and slender, standing 11 to 13 inches tall and weighing between 7 to 12 pounds. They have large, erect ears and almond-shaped eyes, contributing to their alert and graceful appearance.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, they are affectionate, lively, and playful, forming strong bonds with their families. They are intelligent and responsive to gentle training methods.</p>\n<p>Historically, they served as vermin hunters on ships. Today, they are primarily companion animals, cherished for their unique appearance and engaging personalities.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics include their minimal shedding, making them suitable for allergy sufferers, and their adaptability to various living environments, including apartments.</p>",
