  "name": "German Wirehaired Pointer",
  "full_description": "<p>The German Wirehaired Pointer (GWP) is a versatile hunting dog developed in Germany during the late 19th century. Breeders aimed to create an all-purpose gun dog capable of hunting various game on diverse terrains. By crossbreeding the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, German Shorthaired Pointer, Pudelpointer, and Stichelhaar, they achieved a breed adept at pointing, retrieving, and tracking both on land and in water.</p>\n<p>Physically, the GWP is a medium to large-sized dog, with males standing 24 to 26 inches tall and females at least 22 inches. Males typically weigh between 55 to 70 pounds, while females range from 45 to 60 pounds. Their most distinctive feature is their dense, wiry coat, which is weather-resistant and water-repellent, providing protection in harsh conditions. Common coat colors include liver and white, often with ticking or roan patterns. They also possess bushy eyebrows and a beard, giving them a characteristic facial expression.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, GWPs are intelligent, energetic, and eager to please. They form strong bonds with their families and thrive on human companionship. Their high energy levels necessitate regular, vigorous exercise to keep them mentally and physically stimulated. While they are affectionate with family members, they can be reserved around strangers, making them effective watchdogs.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for versatility, GWPs excel in various hunting tasks, including pointing, retrieving, and tracking wounded game. Their webbed feet enhance their swimming abilities, making them proficient in waterfowl retrieval. In modern times, they continue to be valued hunting companions and have also found roles in dog sports such as agility, obedience, and field trials.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the GWP include their adaptability to different hunting environments, strong work ethic, and loyalty to their owners. Their distinctive coat not only provides protection but also requires regular maintenance to keep it in optimal condition.</p>",
