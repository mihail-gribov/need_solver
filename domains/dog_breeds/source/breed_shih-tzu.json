  "full_description": "<p>The Shih Tzu, also known as the Chrysanthemum Dog, is a toy breed with a rich history and distinctive appearance. Originating from Tibet, these dogs were bred as companions for Chinese royalty, particularly during the Ming Dynasty. They are believed to be a cross between the Pekingese and Lhasa Apso breeds. Shih Tzus are small, sturdy dogs with a compact body, standing no more than 26.7 cm (10.5 inches) at the withers and weighing between 4 to 7.5 kg (9 to 16 pounds). They possess a broad, round head with a short muzzle, large dark eyes, and a distinctive underbite. Their ears are large and pendant, blending seamlessly with their long, flowing double coat that comes in various colors, including gold, white, and brown. The tail is heavily plumed and carried over the back. Known for their affectionate and outgoing nature, Shih Tzus are friendly, intelligent, and lively, making them excellent companions. They were originally bred solely for companionship and have no working or hunting background. In modern times, they continue to serve as beloved pets worldwide, ranking among the most popular toy breeds. Notable characteristics include their distinctive 'chrysanthemum' facial hair growth pattern and their association with Buddhist mythology, where they are considered sacred and symbolize royalty and bravery.</p>",
