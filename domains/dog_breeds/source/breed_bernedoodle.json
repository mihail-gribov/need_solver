  "full_description": "<p>The Bernedoodle is a hybrid dog breed resulting from the cross between a Bernese Mountain Dog and a Poodle. This intentional crossbreed was developed to combine the Bernese's affectionate and loyal nature with the Poodle's intelligence and hypoallergenic coat. The breed's origins trace back to the early 2000s in North America, where breeders aimed to create a companion dog that embodies the best traits of both parent breeds. Bernedoodles come in three primary sizes: Standard, Miniature, and Toy, depending on the size of the Poodle parent. Their coats are typically wavy or curly, reducing shedding and making them suitable for individuals with mild allergies. Common coat colors include tricolor (black, white, and brown), bicolor, or solid shades, influenced by their Poodle heritage. Temperamentally, Bernedoodles are known for their friendly, affectionate, and playful demeanor. They are highly social dogs that thrive on human interaction and are known to be good with children and other pets. Their intelligence, inherited from the Poodle, makes them highly trainable, though they may occasionally exhibit stubbornness from the Bernese side. Originally bred as companion animals, Bernedoodles do not have a history of specific working roles. However, their intelligence and temperament make them suitable for various activities, including therapy and assistance work. In modern times, Bernedoodles have gained popularity as family pets due to their adaptable nature and hypoallergenic coats. Notable characteristics of the breed include their teddy bear-like appearance, a blend of the Bernese's sturdy build and the Poodle's elegant features, and their ability to adapt to various living environments, from apartments to larger homes with yards.</p>",
