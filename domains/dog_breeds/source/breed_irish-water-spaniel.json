  "full_description": "<p>The Irish Water Spaniel, known as the tallest of the spaniel breeds, boasts a rich history and distinctive features. Developed in Ireland during the 1830s, the breed's exact lineage remains uncertain. However, it is believed to have evolved from native Irish water dogs, possibly influenced by breeds like the Poodle, Barbet, and Portuguese Water Dog. This combination resulted in a versatile hunting companion adept at retrieving waterfowl. Physically, the Irish Water Spaniel is medium to large, with males standing 22 to 24 inches tall and weighing between 55 to 65 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. Its dense, tight, and crisp ringlets of liver-colored fur, often with a purplish hue, provide water resistance. A notable feature is its 'rat tail'—smooth and hairless except at the base, which is covered with curls. The breed's expression is intelligent and alert, with small, almond-shaped eyes and long, low-set ears adorned with loose curls. Temperamentally, the Irish Water Spaniel is confident, cheerful, and affectionate with family members. Known for its endearing sense of humor, it often displays playful antics, earning the nickname 'clown' of the spaniels. While loyal and eager to please, early socialization is crucial, as some individuals may be wary of strangers or other animals. Originally bred for retrieving waterfowl, the breed's webbed feet and love for water make it an excellent swimmer. Today, the Irish Water Spaniel serves as both a diligent retriever in field trials and a beloved family pet. Despite its unique attributes, the breed remains relatively rare, highlighting the importance of responsible breeding to maintain its health and working capabilities. Notable characteristics include its hypoallergenic coat, minimal shedding, and distinctive 'rat tail,' setting it apart from other breeds.</p>",
