  "full_description": "<p>The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized, athletic breed originating from Wales, renowned for its distinctive red and white coat and affectionate nature. Historically, this breed descends from the old Land Spaniel, with references to red and white spaniels dating back centuries. Official recognition by The Kennel Club (UK) occurred in 1902, and the American Kennel Club followed in 1906. Initially bred to 'spring' game for hunters using nets or birds of prey, the Welsh Springer adapted to work alongside firearms, showcasing remarkable stamina across rugged terrains and varying weather conditions. Physically, males typically stand between 18 to 19 inches at the withers, weighing 40 to 55 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 17 to 18 inches and 35 to 50 pounds. The breed's coat is always red and white, featuring medium-length, flat, straight, and soft fur with feathering on the chest, legs, ears, tail, and underside. Their brown eyes exude warmth, and their small, vine-shaped ears hang close to the head with light feathering. Temperamentally, Welsh Springer Spaniels are known for their loyalty, earning them the nickname 'Velcro dog' due to their strong bonds with family members. They are gentle and playful with children and familiar faces but may exhibit wariness around strangers. Early socialization is essential to develop their confidence. In terms of working abilities, they are versatile hunters with a strong nose and webbed feet, excelling in activities like conformation, obedience, agility, hunting, tracking, and field trials. In modern times, while they continue to serve as capable hunting companions, they have also become cherished family pets, appreciated for their affectionate and energetic nature. Notable characteristics include their unique red and white coat, unwavering loyalty, and adaptability to various roles, from hunting to companionship.</p>",
