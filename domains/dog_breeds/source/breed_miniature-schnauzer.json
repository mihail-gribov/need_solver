  "full_description": "<p>The Miniature Schnauzer is a small, robust, and energetic breed that originated in Germany during the late 19th century. Developed by breeding the Standard Schnauzer with smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle, the goal was to create a compact and efficient ratter for farms and households. The breed was first recognized in Germany in 1898 and made its way to the United States in 1924, gaining American Kennel Club recognition in 1926. Physically, the Miniature Schnauzer stands between 12 to 14 inches tall and weighs approximately 11 to 20 pounds. It possesses a distinctive rectangular head adorned with bushy eyebrows, a prominent beard, and a mustache. The breed's double coat is wiry and comes in color patterns including salt and pepper, black and silver, and solid black. Known for its alert and spirited temperament, the Miniature Schnauzer is intelligent, obedient, and friendly. It exhibits a strong territorial instinct, making it an excellent watchdog, yet it is less aggressive compared to other terrier breeds. Originally bred for ratting and farm work, the Miniature Schnauzer has retained its working abilities and excels in various performance events. Today, it is primarily a companion dog, cherished for its affectionate nature and adaptability to different living environments. Notable characteristics include its human-like expression, low-shedding coat, and lively demeanor.</p>",
