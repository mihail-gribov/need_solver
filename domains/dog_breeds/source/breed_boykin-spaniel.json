  "full_description": "<p>The Boykin Spaniel, affectionately known as the 'Little Brown Dog,' is a versatile and compact gun dog developed in the early 20th century in South Carolina, USA. Originating from a small stray spaniel-type dog named 'Dumpy,' discovered by Alexander L. White in Spartanburg, the breed was refined by Lemuel Whitaker Boykin to create an adept turkey and waterfowl retriever suitable for hunting in the Wateree River Swamp. Officially recognized as South Carolina's state dog in 1985, the Boykin Spaniel has since gained popularity for its hunting prowess and amiable nature. Physically, Boykin Spaniels are medium-sized dogs with males standing 15.5 to 18 inches tall and weighing between 30 to 40 pounds, while females are slightly smaller at 14 to 16.5 inches in height and weighing 25 to 35 pounds. They possess a rich liver, brown, or dark chocolate coat that is medium in length, ranging from flat to moderately curly, with feathering on the chest, legs, belly, and ears. Their eyes are engaging and bright, varying from brilliant gold to dark amber. Temperamentally, Boykin Spaniels are friendly, sociable, and eager to please, making them excellent family companions. They are known for their energetic and playful demeanor, requiring ample exercise and mental stimulation. Their intelligence and trainability make them suitable for various activities, including hunting, agility, and obedience trials. Originally bred for hunting wild turkeys and ducks, Boykin Spaniels exhibit exceptional retrieving abilities and adaptability to different terrains, including water. Their webbed feet enhance their swimming capabilities, making them proficient waterfowl retrievers. In modern times, while they continue to excel in hunting roles, Boykin Spaniels have also become cherished family pets, known for their affectionate nature and compatibility with children and other animals. Notable characteristics of the breed include their compact size, which allows them to navigate dense underbrush and fit comfortably in small boats without causing instability. Their rich brown coats and expressive eyes contribute to their distinctive appearance, while their friendly and adaptable nature endears them to a wide range of owners.</p>",
