  "full_description": "<p>The Curly-Coated Retriever, often referred to as the 'Curly,' is one of the oldest retriever breeds, originating in England during the early 19th century. Developed through crosses of the English Water Spaniel, St. John's Newfoundland, and possibly the Irish Water Spaniel and Poodle, the breed was designed to be a versatile hunting companion, excelling in retrieving game from both land and water. Their distinctive, tight, water-resistant curls provided protection against harsh weather and dense underbrush, making them particularly suited for waterfowl hunting. Physically, Curlies are large, athletic dogs with males standing between 25 to 27 inches at the withers and females between 23 to 25 inches. They typically weigh around 65 pounds. Their most notable feature is their dense, curly coat, which comes in solid black or liver colors. The curls cover the body, head, ears, and tail, while the face and front of the legs have smooth hair. This unique coat not only offers protection but also gives the breed its elegant and distinctive appearance. Temperamentally, Curly-Coated Retrievers are known for their intelligence, confidence, and independence. They are affectionate with their families and can be playful and sometimes mischievous. While they are generally friendly, they may exhibit a degree of aloofness towards strangers, making early and consistent socialization important. Their original purpose as hunting retrievers endowed them with a strong work ethic and eagerness to please, though they can sometimes display a stubborn streak. In modern times, Curlies continue to be valued as hunting companions, particularly in waterfowl hunting, due to their endurance and swimming capabilities. They also participate in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking. Despite their many admirable qualities, the breed remains relatively rare, often overshadowed by more popular retrievers like the Labrador and Golden Retriever. Notable characteristics of the Curly-Coated Retriever include their distinctive curly coat, which requires minimal grooming; their versatility as both a hunting dog and family companion; and their playful yet independent nature. Their combination of intelligence, athleticism, and unique appearance makes them a cherished breed among enthusiasts.</p>",
