  "full_description": "<p>The Whippet is a British sighthound breed, developed in the 19th century by crossing Greyhounds with smaller terriers to create a swift, agile dog for hunting and racing. Often referred to as the \"poor man's racehorse,\" Whippets were prized for their speed and hunting prowess. They possess a sleek, aerodynamic build with a deep chest, long legs, and a narrow waist, standing between 18 to 22 inches tall and weighing 25 to 40 pounds. Their short, smooth coat comes in a variety of colors and patterns. Whippets are known for their gentle, affectionate nature, being calm indoors yet energetic outdoors. Originally bred for hunting and racing, they excel in activities like lure coursing and agility. Today, they are cherished as companion animals, valued for their adaptability and friendly demeanor. Notable characteristics include their remarkable speed, reaching up to 35 mph, and their strong prey drive, necessitating secure environments during exercise.</p>",
