  "name": "American Foxhound",
  "full_description": "<p>The American Foxhound, one of the oldest American breeds, traces its origins to the early 1700s in Virginia and Maryland. Developed from English Foxhounds brought to America, the breed was refined with the addition of Irish, French, and other hounds to enhance hunting capabilities. Notably, George Washington, an avid fox hunter, played a significant role in the breed's development, aiming to create a superior dog with speed, sense, and intelligence. Physically, the American Foxhound is a tall, lean hound with a close, hard coat that can be any color. Males typically stand between 22 to 25 inches at the shoulder, while females range from 21 to 24 inches. Their weight varies from 60 to 70 pounds for males and 60 to 65 pounds for females. The breed's long legs, deep chest, and slightly domed skull contribute to its endurance and agility. Temperamentally, American Foxhounds are known for their easy-going and friendly nature. They are gentle with children and sociable with other dogs, making them excellent family companions. However, their strong prey drive and independent streak can pose challenges in training, requiring consistent and patient guidance. Originally bred for hunting foxes, the American Foxhound possesses remarkable speed and stamina, capable of covering extensive ground tirelessly. Their acute sense of smell and determination make them exceptional scent hounds. In modern times, while still used in traditional fox hunting, they have also become cherished companions for active families and individuals who can meet their exercise needs. Notable characteristics of the breed include their melodious baying, which can be quite loud, and their low-maintenance grooming requirements due to their short coat. Their friendly disposition, combined with their hunting prowess, makes them a unique and versatile breed.</p>",
