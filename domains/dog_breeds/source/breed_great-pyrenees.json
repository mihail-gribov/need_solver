  "full_description": "<p>The Great Pyrenees, also known as the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, is a majestic breed with a rich history and distinctive characteristics. Originating from the Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain, these dogs were developed centuries ago to guard livestock against predators. Their lineage traces back to ancient times, with evidence suggesting their presence as early as 1800 B.C. in the region. Physically, Great Pyrenees are large, powerful dogs with a well-balanced build. Males typically stand between 27 to 32 inches tall at the shoulder, while females range from 25 to 29 inches. Their weight varies from 85 to 115 pounds, depending on gender and individual genetics. They possess a thick double coat that is predominantly white, sometimes with markings of gray, badger, reddish-brown, or tan. This dense fur provides insulation against harsh weather conditions. The breed's temperament is characterized by calmness, patience, and a strong protective instinct. They are known for their gentle demeanor, especially towards children, making them excellent family companions. However, their independent nature can sometimes be mistaken for stubbornness, necessitating consistent training from an early age. Originally bred as livestock guardians, Great Pyrenees have a natural inclination to protect their home and family. Their keen sense of hearing and alertness make them effective watchdogs. In modern times, while some still serve in their traditional roles, many have transitioned into beloved household pets, therapy dogs, and participants in canine sports. Notable characteristics of the breed include their nocturnal vigilance, a trait developed from guarding flocks at night, and their distinctive double dewclaws on the hind legs, which are a breed hallmark. Their serene presence combined with a formidable protective instinct makes them both a gentle companion and a reliable guardian.</p>",
