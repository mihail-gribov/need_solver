  "name": "Norfolk Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Norfolk Terrier, one of the smallest working terriers, originated in East Anglia, England, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially bred to control vermin populations in barns and stables, these dogs were also employed to bolt foxes during hunts. They share a common ancestry with the Norwich Terrier, with the primary distinction being their ear carriage: Norfolks have drop ears, while Norwiches have erect ears. The breed was officially recognized as distinct from the Norwich Terrier in England in 1964 and in the United States in 1979. Physically, Norfolk Terriers are compact and sturdy, standing 9 to 10 inches tall at the withers and weighing between 11 to 12 pounds. They possess a hard, wiry, and straight double coat that comes in shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle. Their expressive, dark, oval-shaped eyes and small, neatly folded ears contribute to their alert and friendly appearance. The tail is of moderate length, thick at the base, and tapers towards the tip, carried jauntily. Temperamentally, Norfolk Terriers are known for their fearless and affectionate nature. They are energetic, intelligent, and thrive on human companionship, making them excellent family pets. Their sociable disposition allows them to get along well with children and other animals when properly socialized. Despite their small size, they exhibit a strong prey drive and may chase small animals outdoors. Originally bred for hunting and vermin control, Norfolk Terriers possess a keen sense of smell and determination, traits that made them effective in their traditional roles. Today, they excel in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and earthdog trials, showcasing their versatility and eagerness to work. In modern times, Norfolk Terriers have transitioned from their working origins to become cherished companions worldwide. Their adaptable nature makes them suitable for both urban and rural living environments. While they are not as common as some other breeds, their loyal and spirited character has earned them a dedicated following among dog enthusiasts. Notable characteristics of the Norfolk Terrier include their compact size, making them ideal for various living situations; their low-shedding, weather-resistant coat; and their balanced temperament, combining the tenacity of a working terrier with the affectionate nature of a companion dog.</p>",
