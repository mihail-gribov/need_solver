  "full_description": "<p>The Keeshond is a medium-sized, spitz-type dog renowned for its plush, double-layered coat of silver and black fur, distinctive 'spectacles'—dark markings around the eyes—and a richly plumed tail that curls over its back. Originating from the Netherlands, the breed's history dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries, where they were commonly found on Dutch barges, serving as vigilant watchdogs and companions. Their name is believed to derive from Cornelis (Kees) de Gyselaer, a leader of the Dutch Patriot Party, with 'hond' meaning 'dog' in Dutch. Physically, Keeshonden possess a fox-like face with small, pointed ears, dark almond-shaped eyes, and a mane-like ruff around the neck, giving them a lion-like appearance. Their coat is a mix of gray, black, and cream, with the undercoat being pale gray or cream. Temperamentally, they are friendly, alert, and intelligent, making them excellent family companions. They are known for their affectionate nature, often forming strong bonds with their owners and displaying a keen sense of empathy. Historically bred as watchdogs, they are naturally alert and will bark to announce visitors but are not aggressive. In modern times, Keeshonden have transitioned from their roles on barges to being cherished family pets and therapy dogs, appreciated for their sociable nature and adaptability. Notable characteristics include their expressive facial markings, which give the appearance of wearing glasses, and their thick double coat that requires regular grooming to maintain its condition.</p>",
