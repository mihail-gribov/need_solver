  "full_description": "<p>The Neapolitan Mastiff, or Mastino Napoletano, is an ancient Italian breed renowned for its massive size, distinctive wrinkled appearance, and protective nature. Originating from central Italy, particularly around Naples, this breed descends from the traditional guard dogs used by Roman legions. These dogs were bred for guarding and defending properties and their inhabitants. The breed was officially recognized by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1949 and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1956. Physically, Neapolitan Mastiffs are large, heavy-boned dogs with a stocky build. Males typically stand between 26 to 31 inches tall and weigh around 150 pounds, while females are slightly smaller. Their skin is loose and abundant, especially around the head, forming characteristic wrinkles and folds. The coat is short and dense, commonly found in colors like black, grey, lead grey, mahogany, and fawn, often with brindling. Temperamentally, Neapolitan Mastiffs are steady, loyal, and protective. They form strong bonds with their families and are gentle with children. However, they can be wary of strangers and may not always get along with other pets. Their original purpose was to serve as guard dogs, a role they performed with vigilance and intelligence. In modern times, they continue to be valued as protective companions and are appreciated for their imposing presence and affectionate nature. Notable characteristics include their massive size, distinctive wrinkled skin, and a calm yet protective demeanor.</p>",
