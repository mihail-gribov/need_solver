  "full_description": "<p>The Portuguese Water Dog (PWD) is a robust, medium-sized breed with a rich history as a fisherman's companion along Portugal's coast. Originating in the Algarve region, these dogs were integral to fishing operations, performing tasks such as herding fish into nets, retrieving lost equipment, and delivering messages between boats. Their webbed feet and waterproof coats made them exceptional swimmers, capable of enduring long hours in the water. Physically, PWDs exhibit a sturdy, square-shaped build with well-developed muscles. Males typically stand between 50-57 cm (19.5-22.5 inches) tall and weigh 19-25 kg (42-55 lbs), while females are slightly smaller, measuring 43-52 cm (17-20.5 inches) in height and weighing 16-22 kg (35-48 lbs). Their dense, profuse coats come in two varieties: curly and wavy, and are commonly found in black, white, or various shades of brown. Notably, their coats lack an undercoat, contributing to their low-shedding nature. Temperamentally, PWDs are intelligent, energetic, and affectionate. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty and protective instincts. Their high energy levels and keen intellect necessitate regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and associated behavioral issues. Historically bred for demanding tasks, PWDs possess remarkable working abilities. Their original roles required strength, endurance, and problem-solving skills, traits that remain evident today. In contemporary settings, they excel in various canine sports, including agility, obedience, and water trials, showcasing their versatility and eagerness to work. In recent years, the breed has gained popularity as a family companion, partly due to their hypoallergenic coats and engaging personalities. Notably, PWDs have been part of prominent households, such as the Obama family, further elevating their profile. Despite their modern roles, they retain the distinctive characteristics that made them invaluable to Portuguese fishermen: a strong work ethic, adaptability, and a love for water.</p>",
