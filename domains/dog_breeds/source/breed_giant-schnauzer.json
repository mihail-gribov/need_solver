  "full_description": "<p>The Giant Schnauzer, originating in 17th-century Germany, was developed to drive cattle and guard properties. Breeders combined Standard Schnauzers with larger breeds like Great Danes and rough-haired sheepdogs to create a robust, versatile working dog. This breed is characterized by a strong, square build, standing between 23.5 to 27.5 inches tall and weighing 55 to 95 pounds. They possess a dense, wiry double coat, typically in solid black or salt-and-pepper colors, complemented by distinctive bushy eyebrows and a beard. Known for their intelligence and loyalty, Giant Schnauzers are protective of their families and can be wary of strangers. Their high energy levels and working heritage necessitate regular physical and mental stimulation. Historically used for cattle driving and guarding, they have also served in police and military roles. Today, they excel in various canine sports and are valued as both working dogs and family companions. Notable traits include their alertness, versatility, and strong protective instincts.</p>",
