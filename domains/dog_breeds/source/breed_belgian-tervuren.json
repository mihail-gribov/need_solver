  "full_description": "<p>The Belgian Tervuren, one of the four varieties of Belgian Shepherds, originated in Belgium in the late 19th century. Named after the village of Tervuren, this breed was developed by M.F. Corbeel, who bred a pair of fawn long-haired Belgian Shepherds, leading to the establishment of the Tervuren variety. Initially bred for herding and guarding livestock, the Tervuren has evolved into a versatile working dog, excelling in various roles such as police work, search and rescue, and service assistance. Physically, the Belgian Tervuren is a medium to large-sized dog with a well-balanced, square build. Males typically stand between 24 to 26 inches at the withers, weighing 60 to 75 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, standing 22 to 24 inches tall and weighing 40 to 55 pounds. The breed boasts a double coat with a dense undercoat and a long, straight, abundant outer coat. Coat colors range from rich fawn to russet mahogany, often with a black overlay and a distinctive black mask. The Tervuren's expression is intelligent and alert, with dark brown, almond-shaped eyes and erect, triangular ears. Known for their intelligence and high energy levels, Belgian Tervurens are affectionate and devoted to their families. They are protective and can be reserved around strangers, making early socialization crucial. Their strong work ethic and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, though they require consistent, positive reinforcement training methods. Originally bred for herding, the Tervuren's agility and stamina have made them adept in various working roles, including police and military work, search and rescue operations, and as service dogs. Their versatility extends to dog sports such as agility, obedience, and herding trials. In modern times, the Belgian Tervuren is appreciated both as a working dog and a family companion. While not as common as some other breeds, they have a dedicated following and are recognized for their versatility and loyalty. Notable characteristics of the breed include their elegant appearance, high intelligence, and strong protective instincts. Their boundless energy and need for mental stimulation make them best suited for active families or individuals who can provide ample exercise and engagement.</p>",
