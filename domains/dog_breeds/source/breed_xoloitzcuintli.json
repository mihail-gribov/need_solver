  "full_description": "<p>The Xoloitzcuintli, often referred to as the Xolo or Mexican Hairless Dog, is an ancient breed with a history spanning over 3,000 years. Originating in Mexico, the Xolo was revered by the Aztecs and other indigenous cultures, who believed the breed had spiritual significance, including guiding souls to the afterlife. Archaeological findings, such as ceramic sculptures, depict Xolos, underscoring their deep-rooted presence in Mesoamerican societies. Physically, the Xoloitzcuintli presents in three sizes: Toy (10–14 inches tall), Miniature (14–18 inches tall), and Standard (18–23 inches tall). The breed is unique in offering both hairless and coated varieties. The hairless Xolos have smooth, tough skin, often with a few coarse hairs on the head, tail, and feet, while the coated variety boasts a short, sleek coat. Their appearance is marked by large, bat-like ears, almond-shaped eyes, and a graceful, athletic build. Temperamentally, Xolos are known for their calm, attentive, and loyal nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are often reserved around strangers, making them excellent watchdogs. Their intelligence and eagerness to please contribute to their trainability. Historically, Xolos served as companions, hunters, and even healers, with their warm bodies believed to alleviate ailments. In contemporary times, they are cherished as loyal companions and have gained recognition in dog shows and as cultural symbols in Mexico. Notably, the Xoloitzcuintli was designated as a \"cultural heritage and symbol\" of Mexico City in 2016. Distinctive characteristics of the breed include their hairless variety's unique skin care needs, their ancient lineage, and their adaptability to various living environments.</p>",
