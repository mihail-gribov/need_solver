  "full_description": "<p>The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, affectionately known as the 'Swissy,' is a robust and versatile breed originating from the Swiss Alps. Developed as an all-purpose farm dog, the Swissy was utilized for herding livestock, guarding property, and pulling heavy carts, earning the nickname 'the poor man's horse' due to its strength and utility. This breed is considered one of the oldest in Switzerland, with ancestors believed to have been present for over 2,000 years. Physically, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog is a large, heavy-boned canine with a sturdy and muscular build. Males typically stand between 25.5 to 28.5 inches at the shoulder, weighing 115 to 140 pounds, while females range from 23.5 to 27 inches and weigh between 85 to 110 pounds. They possess a distinctive tricolor coat—black with rust and white markings. The coat is short, dense, and double-layered, providing protection against harsh weather conditions. The breed's head is broad and flat, with medium-sized, almond-shaped eyes that exude an alert and friendly expression. Temperamentally, Swissies are known for their friendly, outgoing, and playful nature. They are deeply devoted to their families, displaying a strong affinity for people and children. Their sociable and confident demeanor makes them excellent companions, though they can be reserved with strangers, showcasing their natural watchdog instincts. Despite their size, they are agile and enjoy participating in various activities, reflecting their working heritage. Historically, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog was bred for demanding tasks such as herding cattle, guarding farms, and pulling carts loaded with goods. Their strength and endurance made them invaluable in the mountainous regions of Switzerland. In modern times, while they continue to excel in working roles, they have also become cherished family pets. Their versatility allows them to participate in activities like obedience trials, agility, herding, and drafting competitions. Notable characteristics of the breed include their impressive physical strength, keen intelligence, and unwavering loyalty. They thrive on human companionship and are happiest when included in family activities.
