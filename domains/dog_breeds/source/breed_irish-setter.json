  "name": "Irish Setter",
  "full_description": "<p>The Irish Setter, originating in Ireland during the 18th century, was developed by crossing spaniels, other setters, pointers, and the Irish Terrier to create an adept bird dog. Initially, both red and red-and-white varieties existed, but selective breeding led to the prominence of the solid red coat by the 19th century. This breed is renowned for its striking mahogany or rich chestnut red coat, which is moderately long, silky, and features feathering on the ears, chest, tail, and legs. Males typically stand around 27 inches tall and weigh approximately 70 pounds, while females are about 25 inches tall and weigh around 60 pounds. Irish Setters possess a lean, long head with a well-defined stop, dark to medium brown almond-shaped eyes, and ears set well back and low, lying close to the head. Their neck is strong and slightly arched, leading to a deep chest and well-sprung ribs. The tail is strong at the root, tapering to a fine point, and carried nearly level with the back. Known for their friendly and intelligent nature, Irish Setters exhibit a rollicking personality. They are energetic, affectionate, and thrive on human companionship, making them excellent family pets. Their sociable demeanor extends to children and other dogs, though their hunting instincts may require supervision around smaller animals. Originally bred for hunting, specifically for setting or locating and pointing upland gamebirds, Irish Setters are tireless, wide-ranging hunters well-suited to various terrains. In modern times, they continue to excel in field trials and are cherished as companion animals, therapy dogs, and participants in dog sports. Notable characteristics include their swift movement, graceful gait, and the ability to cover ground efficiently. Their keen sense of smell and natural pointing instincts make them exceptional in the field, while their affectionate nature endears them to families worldwide.</p>",
