  "full_description": "<p>The Boston Terrier, often referred to as the 'American Gentleman,' is a breed that originated in the United States in the late 19th century. Developed in Boston, Massachusetts, this breed was created by crossing the now-extinct White English Terrier with the English Bulldog, aiming to produce a companion dog with a gentle disposition and distinctive appearance. Recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1893, the Boston Terrier has since become a beloved companion worldwide. Physically, Boston Terriers are small, compact dogs with a square build. They typically weigh between 15 to 25 pounds and stand about 15 to 17 inches tall at the withers. Their short, smooth coat comes in brindle, seal, or black, all with characteristic white markings that resemble a tuxedo. The breed's large, round eyes and erect ears contribute to their alert and friendly expression. Temperamentally, Boston Terriers are known for their affectionate and friendly nature. They are intelligent and eager to please, making them relatively easy to train. Their gentle disposition makes them excellent companions for families, including those with children and other pets. While they are generally sociable, early socialization is recommended to ensure well-rounded behavior. Originally bred for companionship, Boston Terriers have never been used extensively for work or sporting purposes. Their primary role has always been that of a companion animal, providing affection and companionship to their owners. In modern times, Boston Terriers continue to be popular pets due to their manageable size, friendly nature, and adaptability to various living situations, including apartment living. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive 'tuxedo' coat pattern, expressive eyes, and a short, square muzzle. Their brachycephalic (short-nosed) facial structure gives them a unique appearance but also requires owners to be mindful of potential breathing difficulties, especially in hot or humid weather. Overall, the Boston Terrier is a charming and affectionate breed that thrives on human companionship and makes an excellent addition to many households.</p>",
