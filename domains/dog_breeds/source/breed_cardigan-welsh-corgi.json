  "name": "Cardigan Welsh Corgi",
  "full_description": "<p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is one of the oldest herding breeds, originating in Wales over 3,000 years ago. Brought by Celtic tribes migrating from Central Europe, these dogs were developed to herd cattle and guard farms. Their low stature allowed them to nip at the heels of cattle while avoiding kicks. Historically, the Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis were considered a single breed until 1934, when they were recognized as distinct breeds by The Kennel Club in the UK. Physically, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a small to medium-sized dog with a sturdy build. Males typically weigh between 30 to 38 pounds (13.6 to 17.2 kg), while females range from 25 to 34 pounds (11.3 to 15.4 kg). They stand about 10.5 to 12.5 inches (26.7 to 31.8 cm) tall at the withers. The breed is characterized by its long body, short legs, large rounded ears, and a bushy tail resembling that of a fox. Their double coat is weather-resistant, with a hard-textured outer layer and a soft undercoat, coming in various colors including red, sable, brindle, black, and blue merle, often with white markings. Temperamentally, Cardigans are intelligent, loyal, and affectionate. They are known for their even-tempered nature and adaptability, making them suitable for both city and country living. While they can be reserved around strangers, they are devoted to their families and can be playful once comfortable. Their herding instincts may manifest in behaviors like nipping at running children, which requires proper training to manage. Originally bred for herding and guarding livestock, Cardigans are agile and capable of great power and endurance. Today, they excel in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and herding trials. Their versatility and trainability make them excellent companions for active families. Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive long tail, which sets them apart from the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and their wide range of coat colors. Their combination of intelligence, loyalty, and adaptability has contributed to their enduring popularity as both working dogs and family pets.</p>",
