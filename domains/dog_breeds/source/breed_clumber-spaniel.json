  "name": "Clumber Spaniel",
  "full_description": "<p>The Clumber Spaniel is a distinguished breed originating from England, renowned for its substantial build and gentle demeanor. Developed in the 18th century, the breed's name is derived from Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire, where it was first bred. Clumber Spaniels were primarily designed for hunting in dense underbrush, utilizing their strength and endurance to flush out game birds such as pheasants and partridges. Their white coats, often adorned with lemon or orange markings, provided hunters with visibility in the field. Physically, Clumber Spaniels are the largest among the spaniel breeds, standing between 17 to 20 inches tall and weighing between 55 to 85 pounds. They possess a massive head with a pronounced stop, heavy brow, and a square muzzle. Their dense, straight coat features feathering around the ears, belly, and legs, requiring regular grooming to maintain its condition. Temperamentally, Clumber Spaniels are gentle, loyal, and affectionate, often displaying a dignified and somewhat aloof attitude towards strangers. They are known for their calm disposition, making them excellent companions for families. Despite their sedate appearance, they have a playful side and enjoy carrying objects, a trait stemming from their retrieving heritage. Originally bred as gundogs, Clumber Spaniels excelled in hunting through thick cover, using their powerful build and keen sense of smell to locate and retrieve game. In contemporary times, while their role as hunting dogs has diminished, they have found a place as beloved family pets and participants in dog sports. Their unique combination of strength, gentleness, and distinctive appearance continues to endear them to dog enthusiasts worldwide.</p>",
