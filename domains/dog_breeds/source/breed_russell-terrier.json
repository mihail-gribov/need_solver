  "name": "Russell Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Russell Terrier, also known as the Jack Russell Terrier, is a small, energetic breed with a rich history rooted in fox hunting. Originating in England during the early 19th century, the breed was developed by Reverend John Russell, an avid fox hunter, who sought a dog capable of pursuing foxes both above and below ground. The breed's development continued in Australia, where breeders refined its characteristics to create a compact, agile terrier adept at hunting vermin. Physically, Russell Terriers are small, standing between 10 to 12 inches tall and weighing approximately 9 to 15 pounds. They possess a predominantly white coat with tan and/or black markings, which can be smooth, broken, or rough in texture. Their bodies are slightly longer than they are tall, providing a rectangular profile that enhances their agility. The breed's head is flat with a moderate stop, featuring dark, almond-shaped eyes that exude intelligence and determination. Ears are small, V-shaped, and fold forward close to the head. Temperamentally, Russell Terriers are known for their high energy levels, intelligence, and playful nature. They are fearless, confident, and exhibit a strong hunting instinct. These traits make them excellent companions for active families but may pose challenges for first-time dog owners. Their original purpose was to hunt foxes and other small game, a task they performed with remarkable tenacity and skill. Today, while some still participate in hunting and earthdog trials, many Russell Terriers serve as beloved family pets, excelling in various dog sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking. Notable characteristics of the breed include their boundless energy, keen intelligence, and strong prey drive. They require ample physical and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive behaviors. Their small, flexible chests allow them to navigate narrow tunnels during hunts, a trait that remains a hallmark of the breed. Despite their diminutive size, Russell Terriers possess a robust and sturdy build, enabling them to keep up with larger hounds during hunts. Their weatherproof coats require minimal grooming, making them relatively low-maintenance in terms of coat care.</p>",
