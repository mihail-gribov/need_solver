  "full_description": "<p>The Pharaoh Hound, known as 'Kelb tal-Fenek' in its native Malta, is a breed with a rich history and distinctive characteristics. Despite its name suggesting Egyptian origins, modern DNA studies indicate that the breed developed more recently, with its current form established in Malta. Traditionally used for rabbit hunting in the rocky terrains of the Maltese islands, the Pharaoh Hound is renowned for its keen sight, scenting abilities, and remarkable speed. Physically, the breed is medium-sized, exhibiting a noble bearing with clean-cut lines. Males typically stand between 22 to 25 inches (56 to 63.5 cm) tall, while females range from 21 to 24 inches (53.25 to 61 cm). Their weight varies from 45 to 55 pounds (20 to 25 kg). The coat is short, glossy, and ranges from fine and close to slightly harsh, predominantly in shades of tan or rich tan, often with white markings on the chest, toes, or tail tip. One of the breed's unique traits is its 'blushing' phenomenon, where the ears and nose turn a rosy color when the dog is excited or happy. Temperamentally, Pharaoh Hounds are intelligent, friendly, affectionate, and playful. They are known for their sociable nature, enjoying the company of humans and other dogs. Their original purpose as rabbit hunters showcases their agility and endurance, traits that remain evident today. In contemporary settings, they participate in various activities such as conformation shows, obedience, rally obedience, agility, racing, lure coursing, and hunting. While not as widely popular as some other breeds, the Pharaoh Hound maintains a dedicated following among enthusiasts who appreciate its unique history, appearance, and personality. Notably, the breed is the national dog of Malta, reflecting its cultural significance. Distinctive characteristics include their ability to hunt by both sight and scent, their remarkable speed, and the unique blushing trait. Their short, odor-free coat requires minimal grooming, making them relatively low-maintenance in terms of care.</p>",
