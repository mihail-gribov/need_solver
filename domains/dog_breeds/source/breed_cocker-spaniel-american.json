  "full_description": "<p>The American Cocker Spaniel, often referred to simply as the Cocker Spaniel in the United States, is a breed of sporting dog that originated in the United States from the English Cocker Spaniel. The breed was developed to create a smaller, more refined dog suitable for hunting small game birds like the woodcock, from which its name is derived. The divergence between the American and English varieties became pronounced in the early 20th century, leading to the American Kennel Club recognizing them as separate breeds in 1946. The American Cocker Spaniel gained immense popularity in the mid-20th century, becoming the most popular breed in the U.S. during the 1940s and 1950s, and again in the 1980s. It has also achieved notable success in dog shows, including multiple Best in Show titles at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and Crufts. Physically, the American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest member of the sporting dog group, standing between 13.5 to 15.5 inches tall and weighing approximately 20 to 30 pounds. The breed is characterized by a distinctive rounded skull, large dark eyes, and long, lobular ears set at eye level. Its coat is medium-length, silky, and can be flat or slightly wavy, with abundant feathering on the ears, chest, abdomen, and legs. Coat colors are diverse, including solid shades like black, liver, red, and golden, as well as parti-color combinations and roan patterns. Known for its cheerful and affectionate temperament, the American Cocker Spaniel is often referred to as the \"Merry Cocker.\" The breed is intelligent and eager to please, making it highly trainable. While originally bred for hunting, modern American Cocker Spaniels are primarily companion animals, excelling in roles such as therapy and assistance dogs due to their gentle nature. They are well-suited to family life, getting along well with children and other pets when properly socialized. Notable characteristics of the breed include its expressive eyes, which convey a gentle and alert expression, and its merry disposition. The American Cocker Spaniel's combination of beauty, intelligence, and affectionate nature continues to endear it to dog enthusiasts worldwide.</p>",
