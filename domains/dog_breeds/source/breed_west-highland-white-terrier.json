  "full_description": "<p>The West Highland White Terrier, affectionately known as the Westie, is a small, sturdy breed originating from Scotland's western Highlands. Developed in the 17th century, these terriers were bred to hunt rodents that threatened grain stores and spread disease. Their distinctive white coat was intentionally selected to distinguish them from prey during hunts. Physically, Westies are compact dogs standing about 10 to 11 inches tall and weighing between 13 to 22 pounds. They possess a double coat: a rough, hard outer layer and a soft, dense undercoat, both pure white. Their dark, almond-shaped eyes and erect ears give them an alert and lively expression. Temperamentally, Westies are known for their friendly, confident, and playful nature. They are intelligent and quick learners but can exhibit a stubborn streak, making consistent training essential. Originally bred for hunting, they retain a strong prey drive and require regular exercise to stay content. In modern times, Westies have transitioned from hunters to beloved companions, excelling in activities like agility and obedience. Their charming appearance and spirited personality have made them popular worldwide. Notable characteristics include their distinctive white coat, energetic disposition, and adaptability to various living environments.</p>",
