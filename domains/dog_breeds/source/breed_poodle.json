  "full_description": "<p>The Poodle, known as 'Pudel' in German and 'Caniche' in French, is a breed of water dog that has been cherished for centuries. While its exact origins are debated, the breed likely originated in Germany, where it was used as a water retriever. The name 'Poodle' is derived from the German word 'pudeln,' meaning 'to splash.' In France, the breed is called 'Caniche,' meaning 'duck dog,' reflecting its proficiency in waterfowl hunting. Historically, larger Poodles were employed by hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties found roles as circus performers due to their intelligence and trainability.</p>\n<p>Physically, Poodles are distinguished by their thick, curly coats that come in a variety of colors, including black, white, brown, gray, and apricot. The breed is divided into four size categories: Standard, Medium, Miniature, and Toy. The Standard Poodle stands over 45 cm up to 60 cm at the shoulder, the Medium Poodle over 35 cm up to 45 cm, the Miniature Poodle over 28 cm up to 35 cm, and the Toy Poodle over 24 cm up to 28 cm. Despite size differences, all Poodles share a squarely built, well-proportioned body, exuding elegance and athleticism.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Poodles are renowned for their intelligence, making them highly trainable and eager to please. They are active dogs that thrive on mental and physical stimulation. Their friendly and sociable nature makes them excellent companions for families, and they generally get along well with children and other pets. Poodles are also known for their alertness, making them effective watchdogs.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for retrieving waterfowl, Poodles possess strong swimming abilities and a keen sense of smell. Their intelligence and versatility have allowed them to excel in various roles beyond hunting, including performing in circuses, serving as guide dogs, and participating in dog sports such as agility and obedience competitions.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Poodles have gained immense popularity as both show dogs and family pets. Their hypoallergenic coats make them a preferred choice for individuals with allergies. The breed's adaptability and affectionate nature have solidified its status as a beloved companion worldwide.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Poodle include its distinctive grooming styles, such as the 'Continental' and 'English Saddle' clips, which, while often seen as decorative, were originally designed to protect vital organs and joints in cold water. Additionally, Poodles have a long lifespan, typically ranging from 10 to 18 years, with smaller varieties often living longer than larger ones.</p>",
