  "full_description": "<p>The Silky Terrier, also known as the Australian Silky Terrier, is a small, energetic breed that embodies the true spirit of a terrier. Originating in Australia during the late 19th century, this breed was developed by crossing imported Yorkshire Terriers with native Australian Terriers to enhance coat color and texture. The result was a refined, silky-coated dog adept at hunting vermin.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Silky Terrier stands between 9 to 10 inches tall and weighs approximately 10 pounds. They possess a moderately low-set, slightly longer-than-tall body structure with refined bone. Their most distinctive feature is their fine, smooth, and silky coat, which comes in various color combinations, including black and tan, blue and tan, and silver and tan.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Silky Terriers are friendly, lively, and inquisitive. They exhibit a true terrier temperament with a zest for life, making them exceptional companions. Despite their small size, they are courageous and alert, often displaying a protective nature towards their families.</p>\n<p>Originally bred to hunt vermin, Silky Terriers are quick and alert, traits that made them effective in controlling rodent populations. Today, they have transitioned into beloved companion animals, especially suited for urban living due to their compact size and adaptable nature. Their playful and inquisitive demeanor endears them to families and individuals alike.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Silky Terrier include their low-shedding coat, which requires regular grooming to maintain its silky texture and prevent matting. They are also known for their intelligence and trainability, though they can exhibit a stubborn streak typical of terriers. Their alertness and tendency to bark make them effective watchdogs, despite their small stature.</p>",
