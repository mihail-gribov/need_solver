  "full_description": "<p>The Weimaraner, often referred to as the \"Gray Ghost\" due to its distinctive silver-gray coat, is a versatile hunting dog originating from Germany. Developed in the early 19th century by the noblemen of the Court of Weimar, these dogs were initially bred for hunting large game such as deer, boar, and bear. As large game hunting declined, the breed adapted to hunting smaller game and birds, showcasing its versatility. Physically, Weimaraners are medium to large-sized dogs with a sleek, short coat that lies close to the body. Their coat colors range from mouse-gray to silver-gray, and they possess striking light amber, gray, or blue-gray eyes. Males typically stand between 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh between 70 to 90 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, standing 23 to 25 inches tall and weighing 55 to 70 pounds. The breed is known for its athletic build, deep chest, and long, high-set ears. Temperamentally, Weimaraners are intelligent, energetic, and affectionate. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty. However, their high energy levels and intelligence require regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and potential behavioral issues. Originally bred as all-purpose gun dogs, Weimaraners excel in various hunting tasks, including tracking, pointing, and retrieving. Their keen sense of smell and strong prey drive make them adept hunters. In modern times, they have transitioned into roles as family companions, assistance dogs, and even police dogs, particularly in Europe and the UK. Notable characteristics of the breed include their need for consistent exercise, their tendency to be protective of their families, and their suitability for active owners who can meet their exercise and mental stimulation needs.</p>",
