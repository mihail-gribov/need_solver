  "full_description": "<p>The English Setter is a distinguished breed with a rich history spanning over four centuries. Originating in England, these dogs were meticulously developed for hunting game birds such as quail, pheasant, and grouse. Their lineage traces back to the 19th century, with significant contributions from breeders like Edward Laverack and Richard Purcell Llewellin, who refined the breed's characteristics for both fieldwork and show purposes. Physically, English Setters are medium to large-sized dogs, exhibiting an elegant and athletic build. Males typically stand between 65-68 cm (25-27 inches) at the withers, while females range from 61-65 cm (24-26 inches). They possess a long, slightly domed head with a square muzzle, dark expressive eyes, and low-set ears that hang gracefully close to the cheeks. Their coat is long, silky, and slightly wavy, featuring distinctive feathering on the legs, tail, and underbelly. The breed's unique 'belton' color pattern includes combinations such as blue belton (white with black flecks), orange belton, lemon belton, liver belton, and tricolor variations. Temperamentally, English Setters are known for their gentle and friendly nature. They are affectionate with family members, sociable with strangers, and generally good with children and other pets. Their intelligence and eagerness to please make them responsive to training, though they can exhibit a degree of independence. Originally bred as gun dogs, English Setters excelled in locating and pointing game birds. Their keen sense of smell and methodical hunting style made them invaluable companions for hunters. In contemporary times, while they still participate in hunting and field trials, they are predominantly cherished as family companions due to their amiable disposition. Notable characteristics of the breed include their graceful movement, distinctive coat patterns, and a balanced combination of strength and elegance. Their sociable nature and adaptability have endeared them to dog enthusiasts worldwide.</p>",
