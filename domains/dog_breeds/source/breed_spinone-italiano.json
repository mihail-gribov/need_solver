  "full_description": "<p>The Spinone Italiano is an ancient and versatile hunting breed originating from Italy, particularly the Piedmont region. Historical references to rough-coated pointing dogs in Italy date back to at least 500 B.C., with depictions in Renaissance art, such as Andrea Mantegna's frescoes from the 15th century, showcasing dogs resembling the modern Spinone. The breed's name is derived from 'bracco spinoso,' meaning 'prickly pointer,' possibly referring to their coarse coat or the thorny underbrush they navigate while hunting. Traditionally, the Spinone was developed for tracking, pointing, and retrieving game across diverse terrains, including dense forests and marshlands. Their robust build and keen sense of smell made them invaluable to hunters. During World War II, the breed's numbers declined significantly, but dedicated efforts in the mid-20th century led to its revival. The Spinone Italiano is a large, muscular dog with a distinctive rough, wiry coat that provides protection against harsh weather and rough vegetation. Males typically stand between 60 to 70 cm (23.5 to 27.5 inches) at the withers and weigh between 32 to 37 kg (70 to 82 pounds), while females are slightly smaller, standing 58 to 65 cm (23 to 25.5 inches) tall and weighing 28 to 30 kg (62 to 71 pounds). Their expressive faces are characterized by bushy eyebrows, a pronounced beard, and a mustache, giving them a gentle and somewhat comical appearance. Coat colors include solid white, white with orange or brown markings, and various roan patterns. Known for their gentle and affectionate nature, Spinoni are sociable dogs that form strong bonds with their families. They are patient and tolerant, making them excellent companions for children and other pets. While they possess a calm demeanor, they are also intelligent and eager to please, which facilitates training. However, they can exhibit a stubborn streak, so consistent, positive reinforcement methods are recommended. Originally bred as versatile hunting dogs, Spinoni excel in pointing and retrieving game on both land and water. Their endurance and determination make them well-suited for various hunting environments. In modern times, while they continue to be used in hunting, they have also gained popularity as family companions due to their friendly disposition. Additionally, they participate in various dog sports, including obedience, agility, and therapy work. Notable characteristics of the Spinone Italiano include their distinctive rough coat, expressive facial features, and webbed feet, which enhance their swimming abilities. Their adaptability, combined with a friendly and patient temperament, makes them well-suited for both active outdoor activities and relaxed family life.</p>",
