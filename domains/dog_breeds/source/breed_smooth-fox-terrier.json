  "name": "Smooth Fox Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Smooth Fox Terrier, one of the oldest terrier breeds, originated in England during the 18th century. Developed primarily for fox hunting, these dogs were bred to be swift, agile, and courageous, capable of chasing foxes from their dens. Their lineage includes the now-extinct Old English White Terrier, Bull Terrier, and Beagle, contributing to their distinctive appearance and temperament.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Smooth Fox Terrier is a small, well-proportioned dog standing up to 39 cm (15.5 inches) at the withers and weighing between 7.5 to 8 kg (16-18 lbs) for males, with females slightly smaller. They possess a flat, moderately narrow skull that tapers towards the eyes, with a black nose and dark, circular eyes that exude intelligence. Their ears are small, V-shaped, and fold forward close to the cheeks. The neck is clean and muscular, leading to well-laid-back shoulders and straight, strong forelegs. The back is short and level, with a deep chest and powerful loin. Hindquarters are strong and muscular, with well-let-down hocks and a good turn of stifle. Their tail is set high and carried gaily but not over the back. The coat is straight, flat, smooth, hard, dense, and abundant, predominantly white with possible tan, black and tan, or black markings.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Smooth Fox Terriers are friendly, forthcoming, and fearless. They are alert, quick of movement, and keen of expression, always on tiptoe of expectation. Their original purpose was to work alongside foxhounds during hunts, entering dens to flush out foxes. This required a combination of courage, agility, and determination. In modern times, while their role in hunting has diminished, they have found popularity as companion animals due to their lively nature and affectionate disposition. However, their high energy levels and intelligence mean they thrive in active households that can provide ample physical and mental stimulation.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their distinctive smooth coat, predominantly white coloration, and their balanced, athletic build. They are known for their boundless energy and require regular exercise to maintain their physical and mental well-being. Their keen intelligence makes them highly trainable, though they can exhibit a stubborn streak, necessitating consistent and patient training methods. Overall, the Smooth Fox Terrier is a spirited and affectionate breed, well-suited to active families who can meet their exercise and companionship needs.</p>",
