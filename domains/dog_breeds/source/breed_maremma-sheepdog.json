  "full_description": "<p>The Maremma Sheepdog, also known as the Maremmano-Abruzzese Sheepdog, is an ancient Italian breed renowned for its role as a livestock guardian. Originating from the central regions of Italy, particularly the Maremma and Abruzzo areas, this breed has been protecting flocks from predators like wolves for over 2,000 years. The merging of regional varieties in the 19th century led to the standardized breed recognized today. Physically, the Maremma Sheepdog is a large, robust canine with a majestic and rustic appearance. Males typically stand between 60 to 73 cm (23.5 to 28.75 inches) at the shoulder, while females range from 60 to 68 cm (23.5 to 26.5 inches). Their weight varies from 30 to 45 kg (66 to 100 pounds). The breed boasts a dense, harsh, and straight white coat, which may have slight shades of ivory or pale yellow. This double coat provides protection against harsh weather conditions. The head is large and flat, resembling that of a polar bear, with small, high-set triangular ears and dark, almond-shaped eyes that convey a lively and attentive expression. Temperamentally, Maremma Sheepdogs are independent, intelligent, and devoted. They exhibit a strong protective instinct, making them excellent guardians. While they are loyal to their families, they can be wary of strangers, necessitating early socialization to ensure balanced behavior. Their working abilities are deeply ingrained; traditionally, they have been used to guard sheep from predators, working in groups to deter threats. This role has expanded in modern times, with Maremmas being employed to protect various livestock and even endangered species, such as the little penguins on Middle Island, Australia. Their popularity remains strong in rural areas where livestock protection is essential. Notable characteristics of the breed include their exceptional eyesight, allowing them to detect predators from a distance, and their thick double coat, which provides insulation in various climates. Their independent nature means they require consistent, firm training from an early age to ensure they become well-mannered companions.</p>",
