  "full_description": "<p>The Italian Greyhound, the smallest member of the sighthound family, boasts a lineage tracing back over 2,000 years to the Mediterranean basin. Initially bred for hunting small game, they were cherished by nobility across Southern Europe during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, particularly in Italy, which bestowed upon them their name. By the 17th century, they had reached England, where their diminutive size and elegance made them favored companions during the Victorian era. Physically, Italian Greyhounds are slender and graceful, resembling a miniature Greyhound. They stand between 13 to 15 inches tall at the withers and weigh approximately 7 to 14 pounds. Their coat is short, glossy, and fine-textured, coming in various colors except for brindle and black-and-tan patterns, which are disqualifications. The breed's head is long and narrow with a slight stop, and their dark, intelligent eyes convey a keen alertness. Temperamentally, Italian Greyhounds are affectionate and intelligent, forming strong bonds with their families. They are sensitive and may be reserved around strangers, but they are never aggressive. Their playful and gentle nature makes them excellent companions. Historically, they were bred for hunting small game, utilizing their keen sight and speed. Today, they are primarily cherished as loving companions and excel in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and lure coursing. Notable characteristics include their elegant appearance, affectionate disposition, and adaptability to various living environments.</p>",
