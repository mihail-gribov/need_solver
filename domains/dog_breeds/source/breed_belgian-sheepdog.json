  "full_description": "<p>The Belgian Sheepdog, also known as the Groenendael, is one of four varieties of Belgian herding dogs. Originating in Belgium, this breed was developed in the late 19th century by Nicolas Rose at his Château de Groenendael. Initially bred for herding and guarding livestock, the Belgian Sheepdog's versatility led to roles in police work and military service, notably during World War I as messengers and ambulance dogs. Physically, the Belgian Sheepdog is a medium to large-sized, square-proportioned dog with a proud carriage. Males typically stand between 24 to 26 inches tall and weigh 55 to 75 pounds, while females are slightly smaller, standing 22 to 24 inches tall and weighing 40 to 60 pounds. The breed is distinguished by its long, straight, black coat with a dense undercoat, providing protection against harsh weather. The head is elongated with almond-shaped eyes and erect, triangular ears, contributing to an alert and intelligent expression. Temperamentally, Belgian Sheepdogs are intelligent, alert, and protective. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty and affection. Their high energy levels and eagerness to work make them well-suited for various tasks, including herding, obedience, and agility competitions. Their original purpose as herders and guardians has evolved; today, they excel in roles such as search and rescue, police work, and as service dogs. Their intelligence and trainability also make them popular in dog sports and as companions for active families. Notable characteristics of the Belgian Sheepdog include their unwavering loyalty, high intelligence, and versatility. They require regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom and are best suited for owners who can provide consistent training and ample exercise.</p>",
