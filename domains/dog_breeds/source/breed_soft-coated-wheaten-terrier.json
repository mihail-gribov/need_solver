  "full_description": "<p>The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, often referred to as the 'Wheaten' or 'Wheatie,' is a versatile and affectionate breed originating from Ireland. Developed over 200 years ago, these dogs were bred as all-purpose farm dogs, adept at herding, guarding livestock, and hunting vermin. Sharing ancestry with the Kerry Blue and Irish Terriers, Wheatens were commonly known as the 'Poor Man's Wolfhound' due to their utility and accessibility to the common folk. Despite their long history, the breed was officially recognized by the Irish Kennel Club in 1937 and by the American Kennel Club in 1973. Physically, Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are medium-sized dogs, standing between 17 to 19 inches tall and weighing approximately 30 to 40 pounds. They possess a distinctive soft, silky, and wavy coat that comes in various shades of wheaten, ranging from pale beige to shimmering gold. This single-layer coat is known for minimal shedding, making them a suitable choice for individuals with mild allergies. Their expressive eyes and friendly demeanor contribute to their charming appearance. Temperamentally, Wheatens are known for their friendly, energetic, and playful nature. They are intelligent and eager to please, which makes them responsive to positive reinforcement training methods. However, their terrier lineage can make them somewhat stubborn, necessitating consistent and patient training. They are renowned for the 'Wheaten greetin',' an enthusiastic jumping behavior to welcome people. Originally bred for farm work, including herding and guarding, modern Wheatens have transitioned into beloved family companions. They excel in various canine sports such as agility, obedience, and tracking, and are also utilized in animal-assisted therapy due to their empathetic nature. Their adaptability allows them to thrive in both urban and rural settings, provided they receive adequate exercise and mental stimulation. Notable characteristics of the breed include their hypoallergenic coat, which requires regular grooming to prevent matting, and their enduring puppy-like exuberance that often persists into their senior years. Their strong prey drive necessitates caution around small animals, and early socialization is crucial to ensure harmonious interactions with other pets.</p>",
