  "full_description": "<p>The Bloodhound is an ancient breed renowned for its exceptional scent-tracking abilities. Originating in Europe, its lineage traces back to the St. Hubert Hound developed by monks in 8th-century Belgium. These dogs were bred for their keen noses, primarily to track game such as deer and wild boar. Over time, their tracking prowess made them invaluable in law enforcement and search-and-rescue operations. Physically, Bloodhounds are large, powerful dogs with a distinctive appearance. They possess loose, wrinkled skin, especially around the head and neck, which forms deep folds. Their long, drooping ears and sunken eyes contribute to their solemn expression. The coat is short and dense, typically found in black and tan, liver and tan, or red hues. Temperamentally, Bloodhounds are gentle, affectionate, and patient. They are known for their determination and single-mindedness when following a scent, which can sometimes translate to stubbornness. Originally bred for tracking, they have an unparalleled ability to follow trails over great distances, making them indispensable in search-and-rescue missions and criminal investigations. In modern times, while they continue to serve in professional capacities, Bloodhounds have also become cherished family companions. Their friendly nature and loyalty endear them to many, though their size and energy levels require committed care. Notably, the Bloodhound's evidence has been deemed admissible in U.S. courts, a testament to their tracking accuracy.</p>",
