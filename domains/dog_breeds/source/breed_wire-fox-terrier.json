  "name": "Wire Fox Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Wire Fox Terrier, originating in England during the 17th century, was developed to assist in fox hunting by flushing foxes from their dens. Descended from rough-coated black and tan terriers of Wales, Derbyshire, and Durham, this breed was bred for its agility and determination. Physically, the Wire Fox Terrier is a small to medium-sized dog, standing up to 15.5 inches (39 cm) at the withers and weighing between 15 to 19 pounds (6.8 to 8.6 kg). It possesses a dense, wiry coat predominantly white with black and/or tan markings, and features a flat skull, V-shaped ears folding forward, and dark, keen eyes. Temperamentally, the breed is energetic, intelligent, and friendly, requiring regular mental and physical stimulation to prevent boredom. Originally bred to chase foxes from their dens, the Wire Fox Terrier's working abilities include agility and a strong prey drive. In modern times, they serve as companion animals and excel in dog sports like agility and obedience. Notable characteristics include their distinctive wiry coat, high energy levels, and a history of success in dog shows, having won more Best in Show titles at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show than any other breed.</p>",
