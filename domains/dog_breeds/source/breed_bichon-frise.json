  "full_description": "<p>The Bichon Frise is a small, cheerful dog breed known for its distinctive white, curly coat and affectionate nature. Originating from the Mediterranean region, the breed's history dates back to at least the 13th century. Sailors are believed to have introduced these dogs to Europe, where they became favorites among the nobility in Spain, Italy, and France. The breed's name, 'Bichon Frise,' translates from French to 'curly lap dog,' reflecting its primary role as a companion animal. Physically, the Bichon Frise stands between 9.5 to 11.5 inches tall at the shoulders and weighs approximately 12 to 18 pounds. Its plush, double-layered coat is always white, with a soft undercoat and a curly outer coat that gives it a powder-puff appearance. The breed's dark, round eyes and black nose contribute to its alert and friendly expression. Temperamentally, Bichons are gentle, playful, and affectionate. They thrive on human companionship and are known for their sociable nature, making them excellent family pets. Their intelligence and eagerness to please facilitate training, though they can exhibit a stubborn streak. Historically, the Bichon Frise served primarily as a companion dog, delighting European aristocracy with its charm and companionship. In modern times, the breed continues to excel as a family pet and has also found roles in therapy work due to its friendly disposition. Notable characteristics of the Bichon Frise include its hypoallergenic coat, which sheds minimally, making it suitable for allergy sufferers. Additionally, the breed's lively personality and adaptability make it well-suited for various living environments, from apartments to larger homes.</p>",
