  "name": "Icelandic Sheepdog",
  "full_description": "<p>The Icelandic Sheepdog, Iceland's only native canine breed, traces its origins to the dogs brought by Viking settlers between 874 and 930 AD. These dogs were indispensable to Icelandic farmers, adept at herding sheep and other livestock across the island's rugged terrain. Over centuries, the breed adapted to the harsh Icelandic climate and challenging landscapes, developing into a hardy and agile herding dog. By the mid-20th century, the breed faced near extinction, but dedicated efforts in Iceland and abroad have successfully revitalized its population. Today, the Icelandic Sheepdog is cherished both as a working dog and a companion animal.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Icelandic Sheepdog is slightly below medium size, with males standing approximately 18 inches (46 cm) at the withers and females about 16.5 inches (42 cm). They possess a sturdy, rectangular build, with a length greater than their height. Their expressive, almond-shaped eyes exude intelligence and warmth, while their erect, triangular ears are highly mobile, reflecting their alert nature. A distinctive feature is their bushy tail, which curls over the back. The breed exhibits two coat types: short-haired and long-haired, both double-layered and extremely weather-resistant. Coat colors vary, including shades of tan, chocolate brown, gray, and black, typically accompanied by white markings on the face, collar, chest, and tail tip.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Icelandic Sheepdogs are known for their cheerful, friendly, and inquisitive nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are particularly affectionate with children. Their alertness makes them excellent watchdogs; they will bark to announce visitors but are not aggressive. Their playful and confident demeanor, combined with a gentle temperament, makes them well-suited to family life.</p>\n<p>Historically bred for herding, Icelandic Sheepdogs are agile and energetic, capable of navigating Iceland's challenging landscapes. They are known for their vocal nature, using barking to herd livestock and alert their owners. This trait, while beneficial in a working context, means they can be quite vocal in a home setting.</p>\n<p>In modern times, the Icelandic Sheepdog has transitioned from a primarily working role to also being a beloved companion. Their friendly and adaptable nature has contributed to their growing popularity beyond Iceland's borders. They participate in various canine sports and activities, including obedience, agility, and herding trials, showcasing their versatility and intelligence.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their double dewclaws on the hind legs, a trait rooted in their working heritage. Their thick, weather-resistant coat and sturdy build enable them to thrive in harsh climates. Their sociable and affectionate nature, combined with their alertness and vocal tendencies, make them both excellent companions and effective watchdogs.</p>",
