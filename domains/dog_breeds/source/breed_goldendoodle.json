  "full_description": "<p>The Goldendoodle is a hybrid breed resulting from the cross between a Golden Retriever and a Poodle. This intentional breeding began in the 1990s, aiming to combine the friendly and loyal nature of the Golden Retriever with the intelligence and hypoallergenic coat of the Poodle. The breed has since gained popularity for its versatility and suitability as a family companion. Physically, Goldendoodles exhibit a balanced mix of their parent breeds. They come in various sizes: Petite Mini (under 14 inches, up to 25 pounds), Mini (14-17 inches, 26-35 pounds), Medium (17-21 inches, 36-50 pounds), and Standard (over 21 inches, 51 pounds or more). Their coats can be curly, wavy, or straight, with colors ranging from cream, apricot, and red to black, chocolate, and silver. The texture is typically soft, and many Goldendoodles possess hypoallergenic and low to non-shedding qualities. Temperamentally, Goldendoodles are known for their friendly, intelligent, and confident demeanor. They are loyal and eager to please, making them excellent companions. Their stable and sound temperament makes them suitable for service and therapy work. Originally bred as companion dogs, Goldendoodles have proven their versatility in various roles, including therapy and service work. Their intelligence and trainability make them adept at tasks requiring agility and obedience. In modern times, their popularity has surged, especially among families seeking a friendly and low-shedding pet. Notable characteristics of the Goldendoodle include their diverse coat types and colors, hypoallergenic qualities, and suitability for various roles beyond companionship.</p>",
