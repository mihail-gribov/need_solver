  "full_description": "<p>The Pomsky is a designer dog breed resulting from the cross between a Pomeranian and a Siberian Husky. This hybrid combines the small size and vivacious personality of the Pomeranian with the striking appearance and energetic nature of the Husky. The breed's origin is relatively recent, emerging in the early 2010s as breeders sought to create a companion dog that embodied the desirable traits of both parent breeds. Pomskies typically exhibit a compact, well-proportioned body, standing between 10 to 15 inches tall and weighing around 20 to 30 pounds. Their coat is often thick and fluffy, resembling the Husky's double coat, and can come in a variety of colors and patterns. They possess expressive eyes, which may be blue, brown, or even one of each, and their ears are usually erect, reflecting their alert nature. In terms of temperament, Pomskies are known for their playful, affectionate, and intelligent demeanor. They tend to form strong bonds with their families and are often eager to please, making them relatively trainable. However, they can inherit the Husky's stubbornness and the Pomeranian's assertiveness, which may require consistent, positive reinforcement training methods. Originally, the Pomeranian was bred as a companion animal, while the Siberian Husky was developed for sledding and endurance tasks. The Pomsky, being a mix of these breeds, does not have a specific working purpose but is primarily bred for companionship. In modern times, Pomskies have gained popularity due to their unique appearance and adaptable size, making them suitable for various living environments, including apartments and houses with yards. Notable characteristics of the Pomsky include their high energy levels, requiring regular exercise to maintain their physical and mental health. They are also known for their vocal nature, often expressing themselves through barks and howls, a trait inherited from the Husky lineage. Additionally, their thick coats necessitate regular grooming to prevent matting and to manage shedding.</p>",
