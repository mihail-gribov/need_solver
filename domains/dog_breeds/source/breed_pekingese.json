  "full_description": "<p>The Pekingese is an ancient toy breed originating from China, revered for centuries as a companion to Chinese royalty. Believed to have been bred to resemble the 'Foo Dog' or Chinese guardian lions, Pekingese were exclusive to the imperial court, symbolizing nobility and status. Their introduction to the Western world occurred in the mid-19th century when British forces brought them to England after the Second Opium War. Official recognition by the American Kennel Club (AKC) followed in 1906, cementing their global appeal.</p>\n<p>Physically, Pekingese are small yet sturdy dogs, standing between 6 to 9 inches (15–23 cm) tall at the shoulder and weighing between 7 to 14 pounds (3.2–6.4 kg). They possess a compact, muscular body with a broad chest and a distinctive rolling gait. Their large, round eyes and short, black muzzle contribute to their unique facial expression. The breed's double coat is long and flowing, forming a mane-like appearance around the neck and shoulders, reminiscent of a lion's mane. Coat colors are diverse, including fawn, black, cream, red, sable, white, and biscuit, often with black masks or white markings. Their heart-shaped ears hang close to the head with heavy feathering, and the tail is set high, carried over the back with a fringe.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Pekingese are dignified and confident, often exhibiting an independent and sometimes aloof demeanor. They are loyal and affectionate with their families but can be reserved around strangers. Their regal bearing reflects their historical status as companions to royalty. While they are intelligent, their strong-willed nature can make training a challenge; they respond best to positive reinforcement techniques.</p>\n<p>Originally bred as lapdogs and companions for Chinese emperors, Pekingese were not developed for specific working abilities. Their primary role was to provide companionship and serve as a status symbol within the imperial court. In modern times, they continue to fulfill this role, cherished as affectionate and loyal companions. Their small size and moderate exercise needs make them well-suited to apartment living, and they are often seen in dog shows, where their distinctive appearance and demeanor are celebrated.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Pekingese include their lion-like appearance, a testament to their breeding to resemble Chinese guardian lions. Their unique rolling gait and distinctive facial features set them apart from other breeds. Despite their small stature, they carry themselves with a sense of self-importance and dignity, embodying the noble heritage from which they descend.</p>",
