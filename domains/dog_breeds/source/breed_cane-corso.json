  "full_description": "<p>The Cane Corso, also known as the Italian Mastiff, is a robust and muscular breed with deep historical roots in Italy. Originating from the Roman era, these dogs were initially bred as war dogs and later adapted to various roles such as hunting large game and guarding livestock. Their lineage traces back to ancient molossian dogs, and they have been integral to Italian rural life for centuries. Physically, the Cane Corso presents a powerful and athletic build. Males typically stand between 64–68 cm at the withers, while females measure slightly less. Their weight ranges from 40 to 50 kg, proportionate to their size. The breed's coat is short, dense, and lustrous, coming in colors like black, various shades of gray, fawn, and brindle. A distinctive feature is their large, broad head with a well-defined stop and a deep muzzle. Temperamentally, Cane Corsos are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and protective nature. They form strong bonds with their families and are naturally wary of strangers, making them excellent guard dogs. Their confident demeanor requires consistent training and socialization from an early age to ensure they are well-adjusted and obedient. Historically, their working abilities were diverse, ranging from guarding properties and livestock to hunting large game. In modern times, while they still serve as protectors, many Cane Corsos are cherished as family companions. Their popularity has been on the rise, with the breed climbing from nearly 50th to 14th place in the American Kennel Club's rankings over a decade. Notable characteristics of the Cane Corso include their keen intelligence, strong protective instincts, and a calm yet assertive presence. They thrive in environments where they have a clear role and benefit from regular mental and physical stimulation.</p>",
