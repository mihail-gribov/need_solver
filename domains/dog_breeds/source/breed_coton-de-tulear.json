  "full_description": "<p>The Coton de Tulear, often referred to as the 'Royal Dog of Madagascar,' is a small, sturdy companion breed with a rich history and distinctive appearance. Originating from the island of Madagascar, the breed's ancestors are believed to have arrived via shipwrecks in the 16th century, where they adapted to the island's environment and eventually became favored by the Malagasy nobility.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Coton de Tulear is characterized by its long, soft, cotton-like coat, which is predominantly white, though slight shadings of light grey or red-roan are permitted on the ears. The breed has a slightly rounded skull, large dark eyes with expressive features, and ears that are set high and carried close to the cheeks. The body is slightly longer than tall, with a topline that is very slightly arched over the loin, and a tail that is happily carried curved over the back when in motion.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Cotons are known for their happy, stable, and sociable nature. They are intelligent, lively, and adapt well to various lifestyles, making them excellent companions. Their clownish and lighthearted demeanor, combined with a gentle and sympathetic awareness of those around them, endears them to many.</p>\n<p>Historically, the Coton de Tulear was not bred for specific working abilities but rather as a companion dog. Their primary role was to provide companionship to the Malagasy aristocracy, a purpose they continue to fulfill today. In modern times, the breed has gained popularity worldwide, recognized by major kennel clubs such as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 1971 and the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 2014.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Coton de Tulear include their low-shedding coat, which is considered hypoallergenic, making them suitable for individuals with mild allergies. They are also known for their unique vocalizations and expressive 'smile,' adding to their charm as companion animals.</p>",
