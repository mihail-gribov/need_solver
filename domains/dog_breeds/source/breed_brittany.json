  "full_description": "<p>The Brittany, originating from the Brittany region in northwestern France, is a versatile and energetic gun dog developed primarily for bird hunting. Historical records, including 17th-century paintings and tapestries, depict Brittany-like dogs, indicating the breed's longstanding presence. The first written account dates back to 1850, describing small, bobtailed dogs adept at pointing and retrieving. Official recognition in France occurred in 1907, with the American Kennel Club (AKC) acknowledging the breed in 1934. In 1982, the AKC dropped 'Spaniel' from the breed's name to reflect its pointing rather than flushing abilities.</p>\n<p>Physically, the Brittany is a medium-sized, leggy dog standing between 17.5 to 20.5 inches at the shoulder and weighing 30 to 40 pounds. Its coat is dense and can be flat or wavy, commonly found in orange and white or liver and white combinations. Some Brittanys are born with a natural bobtail; others have tails docked to approximately four inches. The breed's expressive eyes, set under bushy eyebrows, are typically amber to hazel, complementing its keen and alert expression.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Brittanys are affectionate, intelligent, and eager to please. They exhibit a happy and alert demeanor, making them excellent companions for active families. Their high energy levels necessitate regular, vigorous exercise to prevent restlessness or undesirable behaviors. Early socialization and obedience training are recommended to harness their enthusiasm and ensure well-rounded behavior.</p>\n<p>Originally bred for hunting, Brittanys excel in pointing and retrieving game birds. Their keen sense of smell and agility make them proficient in various terrains, from woods to plains. In modern times, they continue to be favored by hunters and have also gained popularity in dog sports such as agility, flyball, and obedience competitions. Their friendly nature and manageable size have contributed to their status as beloved family pets.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the Brittany include its exceptional versatility in hunting and sports, a compact and athletic build, and a coat that provides protection without excessive maintenance. Their boundless energy and affectionate nature make them well-suited for active households seeking an engaging and loyal companion.</p>",
