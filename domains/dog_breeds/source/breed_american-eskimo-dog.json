  "full_description": "<p>The American Eskimo Dog, often referred to as the 'Eskie,' is a member of the Spitz family, characterized by its striking white coat and keen intelligence. Originating from the German Spitz, the breed was brought to the United States by German immigrants in the early 20th century. Due to anti-German sentiment during World War I, the breed's name was changed to American Eskimo Dog in 1917. Historically, Eskies gained popularity in the 1930s and 1940s as circus performers, showcasing their agility and trainability. Physically, the American Eskimo Dog boasts a thick, double-layered coat that is predominantly white, with some individuals displaying biscuit cream markings. Their wedge-shaped head features erect, triangular ears and distinctive black points on the nose, lips, and eye rims. The breed comes in three size varieties: Toy (9–12 inches in height), Miniature (12–15 inches), and Standard (15–19 inches). Temperamentally, Eskies are known for their friendly, outgoing, and intelligent nature. They are affectionate with family members and can be reserved around strangers, making them excellent watchdogs. Their high energy levels and eagerness to please make them highly trainable, though they can exhibit stubbornness if not properly guided. Originally bred as companion animals and watchdogs, their intelligence and agility made them ideal for circus performances. Today, they serve primarily as companion animals and excel in obedience and agility competitions. Notable characteristics of the breed include their alertness, agility, and striking appearance, often described as 'The Dog Beautiful.'</p>",
