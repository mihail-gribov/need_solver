  "full_description": "<p>The Pug is an ancient breed with origins tracing back to China around 400 B.C., where they were cherished as companions for emperors and Buddhist monks. Their distinctive facial wrinkles were intentionally bred to resemble the Chinese character for 'prince.' Dutch traders introduced Pugs to Europe in the 16th century, where they became the official dog of the House of Orange after a Pug named 'Pompey' saved Prince William of Orange from an assassination attempt. Pugs are compact and sturdy, typically weighing between 14 to 18 pounds (6.3 to 8.1 kg) and standing about 10 to 13 inches (25 to 33 cm) tall. They have a short, smooth coat that comes in colors such as fawn, black, silver, and apricot, often accompanied by a black mask and a distinctive 'trace' line along their back. Their large, round eyes and wrinkled forehead contribute to their expressive appearance. Known for their affectionate and playful nature, Pugs are eager to please and thrive on human companionship. They are well-suited for families, getting along well with children and other pets when properly socialized. Originally bred as lap dogs, Pugs have always served as companions rather than working dogs. Today, they continue to be popular pets worldwide, ranking among the top breeds in various countries. Notable characteristics include their charming personality, adaptability to various living environments, and a tendency to form strong bonds with their owners.</p>",
