  "full_description": "<p>The Dalmatian is a distinctive breed known for its unique spotted coat and energetic demeanor. Originating from the historical region of Dalmatia, now part of modern-day Croatia, the breed's exact origins are somewhat ambiguous. Historically, Dalmatians have served various roles, including carriage dogs, firehouse mascots, and even war dogs, showcasing their versatility and adaptability. Physically, Dalmatians are medium-sized dogs, standing between 19 to 23 inches tall at the withers. They possess a well-muscled, athletic build, reflecting their endurance and stamina. Their most notable feature is their short, dense coat adorned with well-defined spots, typically black or liver-colored, which develop fully by around 18 months of age. Temperamentally, Dalmatians are known for their intelligence, alertness, and playful nature. They are loyal companions but can exhibit a stubborn streak, necessitating consistent training and socialization from an early age. Originally bred to run alongside carriages, Dalmatians have a high energy level and require regular, vigorous exercise to maintain their physical and mental well-being. In contemporary times, Dalmatians are cherished as family pets and are also seen in roles such as therapy and service dogs. Their striking appearance and dynamic personality have cemented their popularity worldwide. Notable characteristics of the breed include their unique coat pattern, high energy levels, and a predisposition to certain health conditions, such as deafness and urinary stones, which potential owners should be aware of.</p>",
