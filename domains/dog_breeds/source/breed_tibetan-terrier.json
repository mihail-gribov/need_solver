  "name": "Tibetan Terrier",
  "full_description": "<p>The Tibetan Terrier, often referred to as the \"Holy Dog of Tibet,\" is an ancient breed with a rich history spanning over 2,000 years. Originating in the Lost Valley of Tibet, these dogs were bred by Lamaist monks and local communities, serving as companions, herders, and watchdogs in monasteries. Despite their name, Tibetan Terriers are not true terriers; the designation was given by Westerners due to their size and appearance.</p>\n<p>Physically, Tibetan Terriers are medium-sized, standing between 14 to 17 inches tall and weighing 18 to 30 pounds. They possess a profuse double coat, with a long, fine outer layer and a soft, woolly undercoat, which can be wavy or straight. Their unique, large, flat feet act like snowshoes, providing traction on snowy terrains.</p>\n<p>Temperamentally, Tibetan Terriers are affectionate, sensitive, and intelligent. They form strong bonds with their families and are known for their loyalty. While they are friendly with those they know, they can be reserved around strangers, making them excellent watchdogs. Their adaptable nature allows them to thrive in various environments, from active households to more sedentary settings.</p>\n<p>Historically, these dogs were versatile workers. They herded livestock, guarded monasteries, and even retrieved items that had fallen down mountainsides. Their agility and keen senses made them invaluable in the rugged terrains of Tibet.</p>\n<p>In modern times, Tibetan Terriers have transitioned primarily into companion roles. Their affectionate nature and moderate exercise needs make them suitable for families, singles, and seniors alike. While not as common as some other breeds, they have a dedicated following and are recognized by major kennel clubs worldwide.</p>\n<p>Notable characteristics of the breed include their unique foot structure, which provides stability on uneven terrains, and their long, flowing coats that require regular grooming. Their history as \"Holy Dogs\" and symbols of good luck adds to their allure and mystique.</p>",
