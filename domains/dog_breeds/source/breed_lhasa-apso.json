  "full_description": "<p>The Lhasa Apso is a small, hardy breed originating from Tibet, where it served as a sentinel in Buddhist monasteries and homes. Named after Tibet's capital city, Lhasa, and the Tibetan word 'apso,' meaning 'bearded,' this breed was revered as a symbol of good luck and often gifted to dignitaries. Physically, the Lhasa Apso stands about 10 to 11 inches tall and weighs between 12 to 18 pounds. It possesses a long, dense double coat that comes in various colors, including black, white, gold, and parti-color combinations. The breed's dark, oval-shaped eyes and feathered tail, which curls over its back, contribute to its distinctive appearance. Temperamentally, Lhasa Apsos are known for their alertness, intelligence, and independence. They are affectionate with family members but can be wary of strangers, a trait stemming from their watchdog origins. While they are playful and loyal, they may exhibit stubbornness, requiring consistent training and socialization. Historically, their primary role was to alert larger guard dogs to intruders, utilizing their keen hearing and sharp bark. In modern times, Lhasa Apsos have transitioned into companion animals, cherished for their loyal and protective nature. Notable characteristics include their longevity, with many living into their early 20s, and their minimal shedding, making them suitable for individuals with mild allergies.</p>",
